<em>Cloggit</em>! How does all at your house this
morning?</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> Think you kindly, <em>Mrs.</em> Amlet, thank you
kindly; how do you do, I pray?</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> At the old rate, neighbour, poor and honest;
these are hard times, good lack.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> If they are hard with you, what are they with
us? You have a good trade going, all the great folks in
town help off with your merchandize.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Yes, they do help us off with 'em indeed; they
buy all.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> And pay&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> For some.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[Pg 8]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> Well, 'tis a thousand pities, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>, they
are not as ready at one, as they are at t'other: For, not
to wrong 'em, they give very good rates.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> O for that, let us do them justice, neighbour; they
never make two words upon the price, all they haggle
about is the day of payment.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> There's all the dispute, as you say.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> But that's a wicked one: For my part, neighbour,
I'm just tir'd off my legs with trotting after 'em;
beside, it eats out all our profit. Would you believe it,
Mrs. <em>Cloggit</em>, I have worn out four pair of pattens, with
following my old Lady <em>Youthful</em>, for one set of false teeth,
and but three pots of paint.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> Look you there now.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> If they would but once let me get enough by
'em, to keep a coach to carry me a dunning after 'em,
there would be some conscience in it.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> Ay, that were something. But now you talk of
conscience, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>, how do you speed among your
city customers?</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> My city customers! Now by my truth, neighbour,
between the city and the court (with reverence
be it spoken) there's not a &mdash;&mdash; to choose. My ladies
in the city in times past, were as full of gold as they
were of religion, and as punctual in their payments
as they were of their prayers; but since they have set
their minds upon quality, adieu one, adieu t'other, their
money and their conscience are gone, heaven knows
where. There is not a goldsmith's wife to be found in
town, but's as hard-hearted as an ancient judge, and as
poor as a towering dutchess.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> But what the murrain have they to do with
quality, why don't their husbands make e'm mind their
shops?</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Their husbands! their husbands, say'st thou,
woman? alack, alack, they mind their husbands, neighbour,
no more than they do a sermon.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> Good lack-a-day, that women born of sober
parents, should be prone to follow ill examples! But
now we talk of quality, when did you hear of your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[Pg 9]</a></span>
son <em>Richard</em>, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>? My daughter <em>Flip.</em> says
she met him t'other day in a lac'd coat, with three fine
ladies, his footman at his heels, and as gay as a bridegroom.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Is it possible? Ah the rogue! well, neighbour,
all's well that ends well; but <em>Dick</em> will be hang'd.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> That were pity.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Pity indeed; for he's a hopeful young man to
look on; but he leads a life&mdash;&mdash;Well&mdash;&mdash;where
he has it, heav'n knows; but they say, he pays his
club with the best of 'em. I have seen him but once
these three months, neighbour, and then the varlet
wanted money; but I bid him march, and march he did
to some purpose; for in less than an hour, back comes
my gentleman into the house, walks to and fro in the
room, with his wig over his shoulder, his hat on one
side, whistling a minuet, and tossing a purse of gold
from one hand to t'other, with no more respect (heaven
bless us!) than if it had been an orange. Sirrah, says
I, where have you got that? He answers me never a
word, but sets his arms a kimbo, cocks his saucy hat in
my face, turns about upon his ungracious heel, as much
as to say kiss&mdash;and I've never set my eye on him since.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> Look you there now; to see what the youth of
this age are come to!</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> See what they will come to, neighbour. Heaven
shield, I say; but <em>Dick</em>'s upon the gallop. Well,
I must bid you good-morrow; I'm going where I doubt
I shall meet but a sorry welcome.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> To get in some old debt, I'll warrant you?</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Neither better or worse.</p>

<p><em>Clog.</em> From a lady of quality?</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> No, she's but a scrivener's wife; but she lives
as well, and pays as ill, as the stateliest countess of
'em all.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exeunt several ways.</em></p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Brass</span> solus.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Well, surely thro' the world's wide extent,
there never appeared so impudent a fellow as my schoolfellow
<em>Dick</em>, pass himself upon the town for a gen<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[Pg 10]</a></span>tleman,
drop into all the best company with an easy
air, as if his natural element were in the sphere of
quality; when the rogue had a kettle-drum to his
father, who was hang'd for robbing a church, and has
a pedlar to his mother, who carries her shop under her
arm. But here he comes.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Dick</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Well, <em>Brass</em>, what news? Hast thou given my
letter to <em>Flippanta</em>?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> I'm but just come; I han't knock'd at the door
yet. But I have a damn'd piece of news for you.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> As how?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> We must quit this country.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> We'll be hang'd first.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> So you will if you stay.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Why, what's the matter?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> There's a storm a coming.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> From whence?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> From the worst point in the compass, the
law.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> The law! Why what have I to do with the
law?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Nothing; and therefore it has something to
do with you.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Explain.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> You know you cheated a young fellow at
picquet t'other day, of the money he had to raise his
company.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Why he's sorry he lost it.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Who doubts that?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Ay, but that's not all, he's such a fool to think
of complaining on't.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Then I must be so wise as to stop his mouth.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> How?</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Give him a little back; if that won't do, strangle
him.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> He might have done if he had not been a
fool.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Why, he robbed a church.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Ay, but he forgot to make sure of the sexton.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Are not you a great rogue?</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Or I should wear worse clothes.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Hark you, I would advise you to change your

<p><em>Dick.</em> And turn ballad-singer.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Not so neither.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> What then?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Why, if you can get this young wench, reform,
and live honest.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> That's the way to be starv'd.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> No, she has money enough to buy you a good
place, and pay me into the bargain for helping her to
so good a match. You have but this throw left to save
you, for you are not ignorant, youngster, that your
morals begin to be pretty well known about town;
have a care your noble birth and your honourable relations
are not discovered too: there needs but that to
have you toss'd in a blanket, for the entertainment of
the first company of ladies you intrude into: and then like
a dutiful son, you may dangle about with your mother,
and sell paint: she's old and weak, and wants somebody
to carry her goods after her. How like a dog will
you look, with a pair of plod shoes, your hair crop'd up
to your ears, and a band-box under your arm?</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Why faith, <em>Brass</em>, I think thou art in the right
on't; I must fix my affairs quickly, or Madam <em>Fortune</em>
will be playing some of her bitch-tricks with me:
therefore I'll tell thee what we'll do; we'll pursue this
old rogue's daughter heartily; we'll cheat his family to
purpose, and they shall atone for the rest of mankind.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Have at her then, I'll about your business

<p><em>Brass.</em> As how?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why all the company she us'd to keep abroad
she now intends shall meet at her own house. Your

her of thee in marriage.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Why, when a man of quality has a mind to a
city-fortune, would'st have him apply to her father and
mother?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> No, so I think: men of our end of the town
are better bred than to use ceremony. With a long
perriwig we strike the lady, with a you-know-what
we soften the maid; and when the parson has done his
job, we open the affair to the family. Will you slip this
letter into her prayer-book, my little queen? It's
a very passionate one&mdash;&mdash;It's seal'd with a heart and a
dagger; you may see by that what he intends to do
with himself.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I can't promise you that; for our young gentlewoman
is not so often in my way as she would be.
Her father (who is a citizen from the foot to the

<p><em>Clar.</em> With <em>Araminta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> This letter from her, is to give me an account
of it.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Methinks you are not very much alarm'd.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> No; thou know'st I'm not much tortur'd with
jealousy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[Pg 15]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nay, you are much in the right on't, Madam,
for jealousy's a city passion, 'tis a thing unknown
amongst people of quality.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Fy! A woman must indeed be of a mechanick
mould, who is either troubled or pleas'd with any thing
her husband can do to her. Pr'ythee mention him no
more; 'tis the dullest theme.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> 'Tis splenetick indeed. But when once you
open your basset table, I hope that will put him out of
your head.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Alas, <em>Flippanta</em>, I begin to grow weary even of
the thoughts of that too.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> How so?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why, I have thought on't a day and a night
already, and four and twenty hours, thou know'st, is
enough to make one weary of any thing.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Now by my conscience, you have more woman
in you than all your sex together: you never know what
you would have.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Thou mistakest the thing quite. I always know
what I lack, but I am never pleas'd with what I have.
The want of a thing is perplexing enough, but the
possession of it is intolerable.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Well, I don't know what you are made of, but
other women would think themselves blest in your case;
handsome, witty, lov'd by every body, and of so
happy a composure, to care a fig for nobody. You
have no one passion, but that of your pleasures, and you
have in me a servant devoted to all your desires, let
them be as extravagant as they will: yet all this is
nothing; you can still be out of humour.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Alas, I have but too much cause.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why, what have you to complain of?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Alas, I have more subjects for spleen than one:
is it not a most horrible thing that I should be but a
scrivener's wife?&mdash;Come,&mdash;&mdash;don't flatter me, don't
you think nature design'd me for something <em>plus elevé</em>?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nay, that's certain; but on the other side,
methinks, you ought to be in some measure content,
since you live like a woman of quality, tho' you are
none.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[Pg 16]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> O fy! the very quintessence of it is wanting.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> What's that?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why, I dare abuse nobody: I'm afraid to
affront people, tho' I don't like their faces; or to ruin
their reputations, tho' they pique me to it, by taking
ever so much pains to preserve 'em: I dare not raise a
lye of a man, tho' he neglects to make love to me;
nor report a woman to be a fool, tho' she's handsomer
than I am. In short, I dare not so much as bid my footman
kick the people out of doors, tho' they come to ask
me for what I owe them.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> All this is very hard indeed.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Ah, <em>Flippanta</em>, the perquisites of quality are of
an unspeakable value.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> They are of some use, I must confess; but we
must not expect to have every thing. You have wit and
beauty, and a fool to your husband: come come,
madam, that's a good portion for one.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Alas, what signifies beauty and wit, when one
dares neither jilt the men nor abuse the women? 'Tis
a sad thing, <em>Flippanta</em>, when wit's confin'd, 'tis worse
than the rising of the lights; I have been sometimes
almost choak'd with scandal, and durst not cough it up
for want of being a countess.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Poor lady!</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> O! Liberty is a fine thing, <em>Flippanta</em>; it's a
great help in conversation to have leave to say what one
will. I have seen a woman of quality, who has
not had one grain of wit, entertain a whole company
the most agreeably in the world, only with her malice.
But 'tis in vain to repine, I can't mend my condition,
till my husband dies: so I'll say no more on't, but
think of making the most of the state I am in.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> That's your best way, madam; and in order to
it, pray consider how you'll get some ready money to
set your basset-table a going; for that's necessary.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Thou say'st true; but what trick I shall play
my husband to get some, I don't know: for my pretence
of losing my diamond necklace has put the man
into such a passion, I'm afraid he won't hear reason.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[Pg 17]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> No matter; he begins to think 'tis lost in earnest:
so I fancy you may venture to sell it, and raise
money that way.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> That can't be, for he has left odious notes with
all the goldsmiths in town.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Well, we must pawn it then.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> I'm quite tir'd with dealing with those pawnbrokers.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Your Honour's most devoted.&mdash;A pretty, civil,
well-bred gentleman this, Mrs. <em>Flippanta</em>. Pray whom
may he be?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A man of great note; Colonel <em>Shapely</em>.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Is it possible! I have heard much of him indeed,
but never saw him before: one may see quality in every
limb of him: he's a fine man truly.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I think you are in love with him, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Alas, those days are done with me; but if I
were as fair as I was once, and had as much money as
some folks, Colonel <em>Shapely</em> should not catch cold for
want of a bed-fellow. I love your men of rank, they
have something in their air does so distinguish 'em from
the rascality.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> People of Quality are fine things indeed, Mrs.
<em>Amlet</em>, if they had but a little more money; but for
want of that, they are forced to do things their great
souls are asham'd of. For example&mdash;here's my Lady&mdash;she
owes you but six and fifty pounds&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Well!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> And she has it not by her to pay you.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> How can that be?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I don't know; her cash-keeper's out of humour,
he says he has no money.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> What a presumptuous piece of vermin is a cash-keeper!
Tell his Lady he has no money?&mdash;Now, Mrs.
<em>Flippanta</em>, you may see his bags are full by his being so
saucy.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> If they are, there's no help for't; he'll do
what he pleases, till he comes to make up his yearly
accounts.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> But Madam plays sometimes, so when she has
good fortune, she may pay me out of her winnings.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> O ne'er think of that, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>: if she had
won a thousand pounds, she'd rather die in a gaol, than
pay off a farthing with it; play money, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>,
amongst people of quality, is a sacred thing, and not
to be profan'd. 'Tis consecrated to their pleasures,
'twould be sacrilege to pay their debts with it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Why what shall we do then? For I han't one
penny to buy bread.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em>&mdash;&mdash;I'll tell you&mdash;&mdash;it just now comes in my
head: I know my Lady has a little occasion for money
at this time; so&mdash;&mdash;if you lend her&mdash;&mdash;a hundred
pounds&mdash;&mdash;do you see, then she may pay you your six and
fifty out of it.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Sure, Mrs. <em>Flippanta</em>, you think to make a fool
of me.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> No, the Devil fetch me if I do&mdash;&mdash;You shall
have a diamond necklace in pawn.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> O ho, a pawn! That's another case. And when
must she have this money?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> In a quarter of an hour.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Say no more. Bring the necklace to my house,
it shall be ready for you.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I'll be with you in a moment.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Adieu, Mrs. <em>Flippanta</em>.</p>

<p>So&mdash;&mdash;this ready money will make us all happy. This
spring will set our basset going, and that's a wheel
will turn twenty others. My Lady's young and handsome;
she'll have a dozen intrigues upon her hands, before
she has been twice at her prayers. So much the better;
the more the grist, the richer the miller. Sure never
wench got into so hopeful a place: Here's a fortune
to be sold, a mistress to be debauched, and a master to
be ruin'd. If I don't feather my nest, and get a good
husband, I deserve to die both a maid and a beggar.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Yes, I have brought some. There [<em>Giving her

<p><em>Clar.</em> 'Tis well; but take care, <em>Flippanta</em>, my husband
don't suspect any thing of this; 'twould vex him,
and I don't love to make him uneasy: So I would spare
him these little sort of troubles, by keeping 'em from
his knowledge.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> See the tenderness she has for him, and yet
he's always complaining of you.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> 'Tis the nature of 'em, <em>Flippanta</em>; a husband
is a growling animal.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> How exactly you define 'em!</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> O! I know 'em, <em>Flippanta</em>: though I confess
my poor wretch diverts me sometimes with his ill-humours.
I wish he wou'd quarrel with me to-day a little,
to pass away the time, for I find myself in a violent
spleen.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why, if you please to drop yourself in his way,
six to four but he scolds one rubbers with you.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Ay, but thou know'st he's as uncertain as the
wind; and if instead of quarrelling with me, he should
chance to be fond, he'd make me as sick as a dog.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Alas, when men are in the kissing fit, (like
lap-dogs) they take that for a favour.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nay, then, I don't know what you'll do with him.</p>

money, since I have it.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why, you want nothing that I know of.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> How aukward an objection now is that, as if
a woman of education bought things because she wanted
'em. Quality always distinguishes itself; and therefore,
as the mechanick people buy things, because they have
occasion for 'em, you see women of rank always buy
things because they have not occasion for 'em. Now,
there, <em>Flippanta</em>, you see the difference between a
woman that has breeding, and one that has none.
O ho, here's <em>Araminta</em> come at last.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Araminta</span>.</em>

<p><em>Aram.</em> As well as a woman can do, that has not slept
all night.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Methinks, Madam, you are pretty well-awake,
however.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> O, 'tis not a little thing will make a woman
of my vigour look drowsy.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> But, pr'ythee, what was't disturb'd you?</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> Not your husband, don't trouble yourself;
at least, I am not in love with him yet.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Well remember'd, I had quite forgot that
matter. I wish you much joy, you have made a noble
conquest indeed.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[Pg 27]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> But now I have subdu'd the country, pray is
it worth my keeping? You know the ground, you have
try'd it.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> A barren soil, heaven can tell.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> Yet if it were well cultivated, it would produce
something to my knowledge. Do you know 'tis in
my power to ruin this poor thing of yours? His whole
Estate is at my Service.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Cods-fish, strike him, Madam, and let my Lady
go your halves. There's no sin in plundering a
husband, so his wife has share of the booty.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> Whenever she gives me her orders, I shall be
very ready to obey 'em.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why, as odd a thing as such a project may
seem, <em>Araminta</em>, I believe I shall have a little serious
discourse with you about it. But, pr'ythee, tell me how
you have pass'd the night? For I am sure your mind
has been roving upon some pretty thing or other.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> Why, I have been studying all the ways my
brain could produce to plague my husband.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> No wonder indeed you look so fresh this
morning, after the satisfaction of such pleasing ideas
all night.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> Why, can a woman do less than study mischief,
when she has tumbled and toss'd herself into a
burning-fever, for want of sleep, and sees a fellow
lie snoring by her, stock-still, in a fine breathing
sweat?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Now see the difference of women's tempers:
If my dear would make but one nap of his whole life,
and only waken to make his will, I shou'd be the happiest
wife in the universe. But we'll discourse more of
these matters as we go, for I must make a <em>tour</em> among
the Shops.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> I have a coach waits at the door, we'll talk of
'em as we rattle along.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> The best place in nature, for you know a
hackney-coach is a natural enemy to a husband.</p>

<p>What a pretty little pair of amiable persons are there

What would they do with their time, if the plaguing
their husbands did not help 'em to employment! Well,
if idleness be the root of all evil, then matrimony's
good for something, for it sets many a poor woman
to work. But here comes Miss. I hope I shall help her
into the Holy State too ere long. And when she's once
there, if she don't play her part as well as the best of
'em, I'm mistaken. Han't I lost the letter I'm to

<p><em>Flip.</em> She's just gone out, so I suppose 'twas no great

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nay, hold a little if you please. I have some
business with you myself, of more concern than what
she had to say to you.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Make haste then, for you know my father won't
let me keep you company; he says, you'll spoil me.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I spoil you! He's an unworthy man to give
you such ill impressions of a woman of my honour.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Nay, never take it to heart, <em>Flippanta</em>, for I

me with his continual scolding, I'm almost weary of my

<p><em>Cor.</em> Nay, I don't know, for I never mind him;

<p><em>Cor.</em> Not pity'd! Why is it not a miserable thing,
such a young creature as I am should be kept in perpetual
solitude, with no other company but a parcel of
old fumbling masters to teach me geography, arithmetic,
philosophy, and a thousand useless things. Fine entertainment,
indeed, for a young maid at sixteen! methinks
one's time might be better employ'd.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Those things will improve your wit.</p>

My mother-in-law has learn'd none of this trumpery,

a mind to, in spite of her husband's teeth?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Look you there now [<em>Aside.</em>] if she has not already
conceived that, as the supreme blessing of life.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> I'll tell you what, <em>Flippanta</em>, if my mother-in-law
would but stand by me a little, and encourage
me, and let me keep her company, I'd rebel against
my father to-morrow, and throw all my books in the
fire. Why, he can't touch a groat of my portion; do
you know that, <em>Flippanta</em>?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> So&mdash;&mdash;I shall spoil her. [<em>Aside.</em>] Pray heaven
the girl don't debauch me.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Look you: In short, he may think what he

free, and I may think in my turn. I'm but a girl, 'tis
true, and a fool too, if you believe him; but let him
know, a foolish girl may make a wise man's heart ache;
so he had as good be quiet&mdash;Now it's out&mdash;&mdash;</p>

spirit, it's a sign she'll come to something.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Ah, <em>Flippanta</em>, if you wou'd but encourage me,

I'll give you advice, when I have got a little more experience.

days, woman. I keep an exact account.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Let me read it, let me read it, let me read it,

<p>Very well, a mighty civil letter, I promise you; not
one smutty word in it: I'll go lock it up in my
comb-box.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Well&mdash;but what does he say to you?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Not a word of news, <em>Flippanta</em>, 'tis all about
business.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Does he not tell you he's in love with you?</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Ay, but he told me that before.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> How so? He never spoke to you.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> He sent me word by his eyes.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Did he so? mighty well. I thought you had
been to learn that language.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> O, but you thought wrong, <em>Flippanta</em>. What,
because I don't go a visiting, and see the world, you
think I know nothing. But you should consider, <em>Flippanta</em>,
that the more one's alone, the more one thinks;
and 'tis thinking that improves a girl. I'll have you
to know, when I was younger than I am now, by more
than I'll boast of, I thought of things would have made
you stare again.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Well, since you are so well versed in your business,
I suppose I need not inform you, that if you don't
write your gallant an answer&mdash;he'll die.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Nay, now, <em>Flippanta</em>, I confess you tell me
something I did not know before. Do you speak in
serious sadness? Are men given to die, if their mistresses
are sour to 'em?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Um&mdash;&mdash;I can't say they all die&mdash;&mdash;No, I can't
say they all do; but truly, I believe it wou'd go very
hard with the Colonel.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Lard, I would not have my hands in blood for
thousands; and therefore, <em>Flippanta</em>,&mdash;&mdash;if you'll encourage
me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> O, by all means an answer.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Well, since you say it then, I'll e'en in and do
it, tho' I protest to you (lest you should think me too
forward now) he's the only man that wears a beard, I'd
ink my fingers for. May be, if I marry him, in a year
or two's time I mayn't be so nice.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ah, <em>Flippanta</em>! How do you do, good <em>Flippanta</em>!
How do you do?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Thank you, Sir, well, at your service.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> And how does the good family, your master,
and your fair mistress? Are they at home?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Neither of them; my master has been gone out
these two hours, and my lady is just gone with your
wife.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Well, I won't say I have lost my labour however,
as long as I have met with you, <em>Flippanta</em>. For
I have wish'd a great while for an opportunity to talk
with you a little. You won't take it amiss, if I should
ask you a few questions?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Provided you leave me to my liberty in my
answers. What's this Cot-quean going to pry into
now?</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Pr'ythee, good <em>Flippanta</em>, how do your master
and mistress live together?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Live! Why&mdash;like man and wife, generally out
of humour, quarrel often, seldom agree, complain of
one another; and perhaps have both reason. In short,
'tis much as 'tis at your house.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Good-lack! but whose side are you generally
of?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> O' the right side always, my lady's. And if
you'll have me give you my opinion of these matters,
Sir, I do not think a husband can ever be in the right.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Little, peeking, creeping, sneaking, stingy,
covetous, cowardly, dirty, cuckoldy things.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Fit for nothing but taylors and dry-nurses.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A dog in a manger, snarling and biting, to
starve gentlemen with good stomachs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A centry upon pleasure, set to be a plague on
lovers, and damn poor women before their time.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> A husband is indeed&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Sir, I say he is nothing&mdash;&mdash;A beetle without
wings, a windmill without sails, a ship in a calm.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A bag without money&mdash;&mdash;an empty bottle&mdash;&mdash;dead
small beer.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A quack without drugs.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A lawyer without knavery.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A courtier without flattery.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> A king without an army&mdash;&mdash;or a people with
one. Have I drawn him, Sir?</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Why truly, <em>Flippanta</em>, I can't deny but there
are some general lines of resemblance. But you know
there may be exceptions.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Hark you, Sir, shall I deal plainly with you?
Had I got a husband, I wou'd put him in mind, that he
was marry'd as well as I.</p>

for you know they are play-fellows.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> O, there's no danger of my wife; she knows

<p><em>Flip.</em> Are you sure she knows that, Sir?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_35" id="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> I'm sure she ought to know it, <em>Flippanta</em>, for
really I have but four faults in the world.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> And, pray what may they be?</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Why I'm a little slovenly, I shift but once a
week.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Fough!</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> I am sometimes out of humour.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Provoking!</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> I don't give her so much money as she'd have.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Insolent!</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> And a&mdash;&mdash;perhaps I mayn't be quite so young
as I was.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> The devil!</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> O, but then consider how 'tis on her side,
<em>Flippanta</em>. She ruins me with washing, is always out
of humour, ever wanting money, and will never be
older.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> That last article, I must confess, is a little hard
upon you.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ah, <em>Flippanta</em>, didst thou but know the daily
provocations I have, thoud'st be the first to excuse my
faults. But now I think on't&mdash;&mdash;Thou art none of my
friend, thou dost not love me at all; no, not at all.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> And whither is this little reproach going to lead
us now?</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> You have power over your fair mistress, <em>Flippanta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Sir!</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> But what then? You hate me.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I understand you not.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> There's not a moment's trouble her naughty
husband gives her, but I feel it too.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I don't know what you mean.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> If she did but know what part I take in her
sufferings&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Mighty obscure.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Well, I'll say no more; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> All Hebrew.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> If thou wou'dst but tell her on't.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Still darker and darker.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_36" id="Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> I should not be ungrateful.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Ah, now I begin to understand you.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> <em>Flippanta</em>&mdash;there's my purse.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Say no more; now you explain, indeed&mdash;&mdash;You
are in love?</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Bitterly&mdash;and I do swear by all the Gods&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Hold&mdash;&mdash;Spare 'em for another time, you stand
in no need of 'em now. A usurer that parts with his
purse, gives sufficient proof of his sincerity.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> I hate my wife, <em>Flippanta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> That we'll take upon your bare word.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> She's the devil, <em>Flippanta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> You like your neighbour's better.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> What pity it is the law don't allow trucking!</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> If it did, <em>Flippanta</em>!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> But since it don't, Sir&mdash;&mdash;keep the reins upon
your passion: Don't let your flame rage too high, lest
my lady shou'd be cruel, and it should dry you up to a
mummy.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> 'Tis impossible she can be so barbarous, to let
me die. Alas, <em>Flippanta</em>, a very small matter wou'd
save my life.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Then y'are dead&mdash;for we women never grant
any thing to a man who will be satisfied with a little.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Dear <em>Flippanta</em>, that was only my modesty; but
since you'll have it out&mdash;&mdash;I am a very dragon; and so
your lady'll find&mdash;&mdash;if ever she thinks fit to be&mdash;&mdash;Now
I hope you'll stand my friend.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Well, Sir, as far as my credit goes, it shall be

her&mdash;my body's hers&mdash;tell her&mdash;my soul's hers&mdash;and
tell her&mdash;my estate's hers. Lord have mercy upon
me, how I'm in love!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Poor man! what a sweat he's in! But hark&mdash;I
hear my master; for heaven's sake compose yourself a
little; you are in such a fit, o' my conscience he'll smell
you out.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ah dear, I'm in such an emotion, I dare not
be seen; put me in this closet for a moment.</p>

<p>A rare adventure, by my troth. This will be curious
news to the wives. Fortune has now put their husbands
into their hands, and I think they are too sharp to
neglect its favours.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Gripe</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> O, here's the right hand; the rest of the body
can't be far off. Where's my wife, huswife?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> An admirable question!&mdash;--Why, she's gone
abroad, Sir.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Abroad, abroad, abroad already? Why, she
uses to be stewing in her bed three hours after this time,
as late as 'tis: What makes her gadding so soon?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Business, I suppose.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Business! she has a pretty head for business
truly: O ho, let her change her way of living, or I'll
make her change a light heart for a heavy one.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> And why would you have her change her way of
living, Sir? You see it agrees with her. She never
look'd better in her life.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Don't tell me of her looks, I have done with
her looks long since. But I'll make her change her
life, or&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Indeed. Sir, you won't.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Why, what shall hinder me, insolence?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> That which hinders most husbands; contradiction.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Suppose I resolve I won't be contradicted?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Suppose she resolves you shall?</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> A wife's resolution is not good by law.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nor a husband's by custom.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> I tell thee I will not bear it.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I tell you, Sir, you will bear it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_38" id="Page_38">[Pg 38]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Oons, I have borne it three years already.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> By that you see 'tis but giving your mind to it.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> My mind to it! Death and the devil! My
mind to it!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Look ye, Sir, you may swear and damn, and
call the furies to assist you! but 'till you apply the remedy
to the right place, you'll never cure the disease. You
fancy you have got an extravagant wife, is't not so?</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Pr'ythee change me that word fancy, and it
is so.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why there's it. Men are strangely troubled
with the vapours of late. You'll wonder now if I tell
you, you have the most reasonable wife in town: And
that all the disorders you think you see in her, are only
here, here, here, in your own head.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Thumping his forehead.</em></p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> She is then, in thy opinion, a reasonable
woman?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> By my faith, I think so.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> I shall run mad&mdash;Name me an extravagance
in the world she is not guilty of.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Name me an extravagance in the world she is
guilty of.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Come then: Does not she put the whole house
in disorder?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Not that I know of, for she never comes into it
but to sleep.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> 'Tis very well: Does she employ any one
moment of her life in the government of her family?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> She is so submissive a wife, she leaves it entirely
to you.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Admirable! Does she not spend more money
in coach-hire, and chair-hire, than would maintain six
children?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> She's too nice of your credit to be seen daggling
in the streets.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Good! Do I set eye on her sometimes in a
week together?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> That, Sir, is because you are never stirring at
the same time; you keep odd hours; you are always<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_39" id="Page_39">[Pg 39]</a></span>
going to bed when she's rising, and rising just when she's
coming to bed.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Yes, truly, night into day, and day into night,
bawdy-house play, that's her trade; but these are
trifles: Has she not lost her diamond necklace? Answer
me to that, Trapes.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Yes; and has sent as many tears after it, as if
it had been her husband.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Ah&mdash;&mdash;the pox take her; but enough. 'Tis
resolv'd, and I will put a stop to the course of her life,
or I will put a stop to the course of her blood, and so
she shall know, the first time I meet with her; [<em>Aside.</em>]

<p>Nay, thou hast a blessed time on't, that must be confess'd.
What a miserable devil is a husband! Insupportable
to himself, and a plague to every thing about
them. Their wives do by them, as children do by dogs,
teaze and provoke 'em, 'till they make them so curs'd,
they snarl and bite at every thing that comes in their
reach. This wretch here is grown perverse to that
degree, he's for his wife's keeping home, and making
hell of his house, so he may be the devil in it to torment
her. How niggardly soever he is of all things he
possesses, he is willing to purchase her misery at the expence
of his own peace. But he'd as good be still, for
he'll miss of his aim. If I know her (which I think I
do) she'll set his blood in such a ferment, it shall bubble
out at every pore of him; whilst hers is so quiet in her
veins, her pulse shall go like a pendulum.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> 'Tis enough, Madam, I'll be sure to give you

<p><em>Clar.</em> Storm, dear <em>Brass</em>, storm: ever whilst you live,
storm.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> O by all means; must it not be so, <em>Flippanta</em>?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> In four and twenty hours, two hundred pounds

<p><em>Flip.</em> I mean right, Sir; my lady'll come home and
go abroad ten times in an hour, when she's either in very
good humour, or very bad.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Good lack! But I'll warrant, in general, 'tis
her naughty husband that makes her house uneasy to her.
But hast thou said a little something to her, chicken, for
an expiring lover? ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Said&mdash;&mdash;yes, I have said, much good may it do
me.</p>

matter.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_50" id="Page_50">[Pg 50]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Now this, I think, looks the best in the world.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Yea, but really it feels a little oddly.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why, you must know, ladies have different
ways of expressing their kindness, according to the humour
they are in: if she had been in a good one, it had
been a kiss; but as long as she sent you something, your

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nay, I do but guess after all; for she has that
grandeur of soul, she'd die before she'd tell.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> But what dost thou suspect?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Why, what should one suspect, where a husband
loves nothing but getting of money, and a wife nothing
but spending on't?</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> So she wants that same, then?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> I say no such thing, I know nothing of the matter;
pray make no wrong interpretation of what I say,
my Lady wants nothing that I know of. 'Tis true&mdash;&mdash;she
has had ill luck at cards of late, I believe she has not
won once this month: but what of that?</p>

none of these things to fret her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

set that upon a card. O&mdash;&mdash;she has a great soul.&mdash;&mdash;Besides,
if her husband should oblige her, it might, in

her inclination to you. No, no, it must never come that

even a sum may look a little suspicious&mdash;&mdash;ay&mdash;&mdash;let
it be two hundred and thirty; that odd thirty
will make it look so natural, the devil won't find it out.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Pounds, too, look I don't know how; guineas

in the right on't; it shall be as you say, two hundred

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ho&mdash;&mdash;well, if it must be guineas, let's see,
two hundred guineas.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> And thirty; two hundred and thirty: If you
mistake the sum, you spoil all. So go put them in a
purse, while it's fresh in your head, and send 'em to me
with a penitential letter, desiring I'll do you the favour
to restore them to her.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Two hundred and thirty pounds in a bag!</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Guineas, I say, guineas.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Ay, guineas, that's true. But <em>Flippanta</em>, if she
don't know they come from me, then I give my money
for nothing, you know.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Phu, leave that to me, I'll manage the flock for
you; I'll make it produce something I'll warrant you.</p>

<p><em>Mon.</em> Well, <em>Flippanta</em>, 'tis a great sum indeed; but
I'll go try what I can do for her. You say, two hundred
guineas in a purse?</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> In short, look smooth, and be a good prince:
I am your valet, 'tis true: your footman sometimes,
which I'm enrag'd at; but you have always had the
ascendant, I confess: when we were school-fellows, you
made me carry your books, make your exercise, own
your rogueries, and sometimes take a whipping for
you. When we were fellow-prentices, tho' I was your
senior, you made me open the shop, clean my master's
shoes, cut last at dinner, and eat all the crust. In
our sins too, I must own you still kept me under; you
soar'd up to adultery with our mistress, while I was at
humble fornication with the maid. Nay, in our punishments
you still made good your post: for when
once upon a time I was sentenced but to be whipp'd,
I cannot deny but you were condemn'd to be hang'd.
So that in all times, I must confess, your inclinations
have been greater and nobler than mine; however,
I cannot consent that you shou'd at once fix fortune
for life, and I dwell in my humilities for the rest of
my days.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> The wicked woman, <em>Flippanta</em>, the wicked

<p><em>Clar.</em> Can any body wonder I shun my own house,
when he treats me at this rate in it?</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> At this rate! why in the devil's name&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Do you hear him again?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Come, a little moderation, Sir, and try what that
will produce.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Hang her, 'tis all a pretence to justify her going
abroad.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> A pretence! a pretence! Do you hear how black
a charge he loads me with? Charges me with a pretence?
Is this the return for all my downright open actions? You
know, my dear, I scorn pretences: Whenever I go
abroad, it is without pretence.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Give me patience.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> You have a great deal, Sir.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> And yet he's never content, <em>Flippanta</em>.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> What shall I do?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> What a reasonable man wou'd do; own your
self in the wrong, and be quiet. Here's <em>Flippanta</em> has
understanding, and I have moderation; I'm willing to
make her judge of our differences.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> You do me a great deal of honour, Madam:
but I tell you beforehand, I shall be a little on Master's
side.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Right, <em>Flippanta</em> has sense. Come, let her decide.
Have I not reason to be in a passion? tell me that.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> You must tell her for what, my life.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Why, for the trade you drive, my soul.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Look you, Sir, pray take things right. I know
Madam does fret you a little now and then, that's true;
but in the fund, she is the softest, sweetest, gentlest
lady breathing: let her but live entirely to her own
fancy, and she'll never say a word to you from morning
to night.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Oons, let her but stay at home, and she shall
do what she will: in reason, that is.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> D'ye hear that, Madam? nay, now I must be on
master's side; you see how he loves you, he desires only
your company, pray give him that satisfaction, or I must
pronounce against you.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Well, I agree. Thou know'st I don't love to
grieve him: let him be always in good humour, and I'll
be always at home.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Look you there, Sir, what would you have
more?</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Well, let her keep her word, and I'll have done
quarrelling.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> I must not, however, so far lose the merit of
my consent, as to let you think I'm weary of going
abroad, my dear: what I do is purely to oblige you;
which, that I may be able to perform, without a relapse,
I'll invent what ways I can to make my prison
supportable to me.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Her prison! pretty bird! her prison! do'nt that
word melt you, Sir?</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> I must confess I did not expect to find her so
reasonable.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> O, Sir, soon or late wives come into good humour:
husbands must only have a little patience to wait
for it.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> The innocent little diversions, dear, that I
shall content myself with, will be chiefly play and company.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> O, I'll find you employment, your time shan't<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
lie upon your hands, tho' if you have a mind now for
such a companion as a&mdash;&mdash;let me see&mdash;&mdash;<em>Araminta</em> for
example, why I shan't be against her being with you
from morning till nigh.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> You can't oblige me more, 'tis the best woman
in the world.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Is not she?</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Ah, the old satyr!</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Then we'll have, besides her, may be sometimes&mdash;&mdash;her
husband; and we shall see my niece that
writes verses, and my sister <em>Fidget</em>: with her husband's
brother that's always merry; and his little cousin that's
to marry the fat curate; and my uncle the apothecary,
with his wife and all his children. O we shall divert
ourselves rarely.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Good.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> O, for that, my dear child, I must be plain with
you, I'll see none of them but <em>Araminta</em>, who has the
manners of the court; for I'll converse with none but
women of quality.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Ay, ay, they shall all have one quality or other.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Then, my dear, to make our home pleasant,
we'll have consorts of music sometimes.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Music in my house!</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Yes, my child, we must have music or the house
will be so dull I shall get the spleen, and be going abroad
again.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Nay, she has so much complaisance for you, Sir,
you can't dispute such things with her.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Ay, but if I have music&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Ay, but Sir, I must have music&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Not every day, Madam don't mean.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> No, bless me, no; but three consorts a week:
three days more we'll play after dinner at <em>Ombre</em>, <em>Picquet</em>,
<em>Basset</em>, and so forth, and close the evening with a
handsome supper and a ball.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> A ball!</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Then, my love, you know there is but one day
more upon our hands, and that shall be the day of conversation,
we'll read verses, talk of books, invent modes,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span>
tell lyes, scandalize our friends, be pert upon religion;
and in short, employ every moment of it in some pretty
witty exercise or other.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> What order you see 'tis she proposes to live in!
A most wonderful regularity!</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Regularity with a pox&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> And as this kind of life, so soft, so smooth, so

partake of it, 'twill be necessary to have the decency of a
porter at our door, you know.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> You will therefore be renown'd in story, for
having the first, my life.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> <em>Flippanta</em>.</p>

her, perhaps she'll insist upon a Swiss.</p>

that the treaty's null, and I go abroad this moment.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Come, Sir, never lose so advantageous a peace
for a pitiful porter.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Why, I shall be hooted at, the boys will throw
stones at my porter. Besides, where shall I have money
for all this expence?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> My dear, who asks you for any? Don't be in a
fright, chicken.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Don't be in a fright, Madam! But where I
say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Madam plays, Sir, think on that; women that
play have inexhaustible mines, and wives who receive
least money from their husbands, are many times those
who spend the most.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> So, my dear, let what <em>Flippanta</em> says content
you. Go, my life, trouble yourself with nothing, but
let me do just as I please, and all will be well. I'm
going into my closet, to consider of some more things<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_66" id="Page_66">[Pg 66]</a></span>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why, truly, my dear, tho' (as you may all
imagine) I shou'd be very glad to recover so valuable a
thing as my necklace, yet I must be just to all the world,
this necklace is not mine.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Huzza&mdash;&mdash;here constable do your duty; Mr.

<p><em>Gripe.</em> I'll die before I part with it, I'll keep it, and
have him hang'd.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> But be a little calm, my dear, do my bird, and
then thou'lt be able to judge rightly of things.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> O good lack, O good lack.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> No, but don't give way to fury and interest
both, either of 'em are passions strong enough to lead a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_83" id="Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>
wise man out of the way. The necklace not being
really mine, give it the man again, and come drink a
dish of tea.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Ay, Madam says right.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Oons, if you with your addle head don't know
your own jewels, I with my solid one do. And if I part
with it, may famine be my portion.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> But don't swear and curse thyself at this fearful
rate; don't, my dove: Be temperate in your words, and
just in all your actions, 'twill bring a blessing upon you
and all your family.</p>

<p><em>Gripe.</em> Bring thunder and lightning upon me and my
family, if I part with my necklace.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why, you'll have the lightning burn your
house about your ears, my dear, it you go on in these

I not bring thee forth? say then.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> What will you have me say? you had a mind
to ruin me, and you have done't; wou'd you do any
more?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_86" id="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> And have had the assurance to put upon us all

<p><em>Flip.</em> And the confidence to think of marrying <em>Corinna</em>.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> And the impudence to hire me for your servant,
who am as well born as yourself.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Indeed I think he shou'd be corrected.</p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Indeed I think he might be pumpt.</p>

<p><em>Brass.</em> Indeed I think he will be hang'd.</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Good lack-a-day, good lack-a-day! there's no
need to be so smart upon him neither: if he is not a
gentleman, he's a gentleman's fellow. Come hither,
<em>Dick</em>, they shan't run thee down neither: cock up thy
hat, <em>Dick</em>, and tell them tho' Mrs. <em>Amlet</em> is thy mother,
she can make thee amends, with ten thousand good
pounds to buy thee some lands, and build thee a house
in the midst on't.</p>

<p><em>Omnes.</em> How!</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Ten thousand pounds, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>?</p>

<p><em>Aml.</em> Yes, forsooth; tho' I shou'd lose the hundred,
you pawn'd your necklace for. Tell 'em that, <em>Dick</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cor.</em> Look you, <em>Flippanta</em>, I can hold no longer, and
I hate to see the young man abus'd. And so, Sir, if
you please, I'm your friend and servant, and what's
mine is yours; and when our estates are put together, I
don't doubt but we shall do as well as the best of 'em.</p>

<p><em>Dick.</em> Say'st thou so, my little queen? Why then if
dear mother will give us her blessing, the parson shall
give us a tack. We'll get her a score of grand-children,
and a merry house we'll make her.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>They kneel to Mrs. <span class="antiqua">Amlet</span>.</em></p>

consent, a fig for her <em>Dick</em>&mdash;&mdash;Why how now?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Pray, Mrs. <em>Amlet</em>, don't be in a passion, the

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_87" id="Page_87">[Pg 87]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Flip.</em> Then all is peace again, but we have been more
lucky than wise.</p>

<p><em>Aram.</em> And I suppose, for us, <em>Clarissa</em>, we are to go on
with our dears, as we us'd to do.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Just in the same track, for this late treaty of
agreement with 'em, was so unnatural, you see it cou'd
not hold. But 'tis just as well with us, as if it had.
Well, 'tis a strange fate, good folks. But while you
live, every thing gets well out of a broil, but a husband.</p>

appear warm to one, to hide a flame for another. <em>Lorenzo</em>
in short appears too compos'd of late to be a rejected
lover, and the indifference he shews upon the favours
I seem to receive from her, poisons the pleasure I else
shou'd taste in them, and keeps me upon a perpetual
rack. No&mdash;&mdash;I would fain see some of his jealous
transports, have him fire at the sight of me, contradict
me whenever I speak, affront me wherever he meets me,
challenge me, fight me&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>San.</em> &mdash;&mdash;Run you through the guts.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> But he's too calm, his heart's too much at ease,
to leave me mine at rest.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> But, Sir, you forget that there are two ways for
our hearts to get at ease; when our mistresses come to
be very fond of us, or we&mdash;not to care a fig for them.
Now suppose upon the rebukes you know he has had, it
shou'd chance to be the latter.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Again thy ignorance appears; alas, a lover who
has broke his chain, will shun the tyrant that enslaved
him. Indifference never is his lot; he loves or hates for
ever; and if his mistress proves another's prize, he cannot
calmly see her in his arms.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> For my part, Master, I am not so great a philosopher
as you be, nor (thank my stars) so bitter a lover,
but what I see&mdash;&mdash;that I generally believe; and when
<em>Jacinta</em> tells me she loves me dearly, I have good
thoughts enough of my person never to doubt the truth
on't. See here the baggage comes.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Jacinta</span> with a letter.</em>
</p>

<p>Hist! <em>Jacinta</em>! my dear.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> Who's that? Blunderbuss! Where's your Master?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_95" id="Page_95">[Pg 95]</a></span></p>

<p><em>San.</em> Hard by.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Shewing him.</em></p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> O, Sir, I'm glad I have found you at last; I
believe I have travel'd five miles after you, and could
neither find you at home, nor in the walks, nor at
church, nor at the opera nor&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Nor any where else, where he was not to be
found: if you had look'd for him where he was, 'twas
ten to one but you had met with him.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> I had, Jack-a-dandy!</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> But pr'ythee what's the matter? Who sent you
after me?</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> One who's never well but when she sees you,
I think; 'twas my Lady.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Dear <em>Jacinta</em>, I fain would flatter myself, but
am not able; the blessing's too great to be my lot: yet
'tis not well to trifle with me; how short soe'er I
am in other merit, the tenderness I have for <em>Leonora</em>
claims something from her generosity. I should not be
deluded.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> And why do you think you are? methinks
she's pretty well above board with you: what must be
done more to satisfy you?</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Why <em>Lorenzo</em> must hang himself, and then we
are content.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> How! <em>Lorenzo</em>?</p>

<p><em>San.</em> If less will do, he'll tell you.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> Why, you are not mad, Sir, are you? Jealous
of him! Pray which way may this have got into
your head? I took you for a man of sense before&mdash;&mdash;Is
this your doings, dog?</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>To <span class="antiqua">Sancho</span>.</em></p>

<p><em>San.</em> No, forsooth <em>Pert</em>, I'm not much given to suspicion,
as you can tell, Mrs. <em>Forward</em>&mdash;&mdash;if I were, I
might find more cause I guess, than your Mistress has
given our Master here. But I have so many pretty
thoughts of my own person, hussy, more than I have of
yours, that I stand in dread of no man.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> That's the way to prosper; however, so far
I'll confess the truth to thee; at least if that don't do,
nothing else will. Men are mighty simple in love-matters,
Sir: when you suspect woman's a falling off,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_96" id="Page_96">[Pg 96]</a></span>
you fall a plaguing her to bring her on again, attack her
with reason and a sour face: udslife, Sir, attack her
with a fiddle, double your good humour&mdash;&mdash;give her a
ball&mdash;&mdash;powder your perriwig at her&mdash;&mdash;let her cheat
you at cards a little, and I'll warrant all's right again.
But to come upon a poor woman with the gloomy face of
jealousy, before she gives the least occasion for't, is to
set a complaisant rival in too favourable a light. Sir,
Sir, I must tell you, I have seen those have ow'd their
success to nothing else.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Say no more; I have been to blame, but there
shall be no more on't.</p>

<p><em>Jac.</em> I should punish you but justly however for what's
past, if I carried back what I have brought you; but I'm
good-natur'd, so here 'tis; open it, and see how wrong
you tim'd your jealousy.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> [Reads.] <em>If you love me with that tenderness you
have made me long believe you do, this letter will be welcome;

<p><em>San.</em> Yes; and what's better, thou and I shall be

hussy, so master and I are going to match ourselves
elsewhere.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> But is it possible, Sir, your honour should be in
earnest? I'm afraid you are pleased to be merry with
your poor humble servant.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> I'm not at present much dispos'd to mirth, my
indifference in this matter is not so thoroughly form'd;
but my reason has so far master'd my passion, to shew me
'tis in vain to pursue a woman whose heart already is
another's. 'Tis what I have so plainly seen of late, I
have rous'd my resolution to my aid, and broke my
chains for ever.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Well, Sir, to be plain with you, this is the joyfullest
news I have heard this long time; for I always
knew you to be a mighty honest gentleman, and good
faith it often went to the heart o' me to see you so
abused. Dear, dear have I often said to myself (when
they have had a private meeting just after you have been
gone)&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>To <span class="antiqua">Car.</span> aside.</em></p>

are women, and what pity it is they should be suffer'd
in a Christian country; what a shame they should be
allow'd to play Will-in-the-wisp with men of honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_100" id="Page_100">[Pg 100]</a></span>
and lead them thro' thorns and briars, and rocks, and

myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Thou hast said enough to thyself, but say a little
more to me: Where were these secret meetings thou

<p><em>Lop.</em> In sundry places, and by divers ways; sometimes
in the cellar, sometimes in the garret, sometimes in the

proofs of it?</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Nay I am determin'd to trust you; but are we
safe here? can no body over-hear us?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Much safer than in a room. No body can come
within hearing, before we see them.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> And yet how hard 'tis for me to break silence!</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Your secret sure must be of great importance.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> You may be sure it is, when I confess 'tis with
regret I own it e'en to you; and were it possible, you
should not know it.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> 'Tis frankly own'd, indeed; but 'tis not kind,
perhaps not prudent; after what you know I already am
acquainted with. Have not I been bred up with you?
And am I ignorant of a secret, which were it known&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Would be my ruin; I confess it would. I own
you know why both my birth and sex are thus disguised;
you know how I was taken from my cradle to secure
the estate, which had else been lost by young <em>Camillo</em>'s
death; but which is now safe in my supposed father's
hands, by my passing for his son; and 'tis because you
know all this, I have resolved to open farther wonders
to you. But before I say any more, you must resolve
one doubt, which often gives me great disturbance;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_103" id="Page_103">[Pg 103]</a></span>
whether Don <em>Alvarez</em> ever was himself privy to the Mystery
which has disguised my sex, and made me pass for
his son?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> What you ask me, is a thing has often perplex'd
my thoughts, as well as yours, nor could my
mother ever resolve the doubt. You know when that
young child <em>Camillo</em> dy'd, in whom was wrapt up so
much expectation, from the great estate his uncle's will
(even before he came into the world) had left him; his
mother made a secret of his death to her husband <em>Alvarez</em>,
and readily fell in with a proposal made her to take
you (who then was just <em>Camillo</em>'s Age) and bring you
up in his room. You have heard how you were then at
nurse with my mother, and how your own was privy and
consenting to the plot; but Don <em>Alvarez</em> was never led
into it by 'em.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Don't you then think it probable his wife might
after tell him?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> 'Twas ever thought nothing but a death-bed
repentance cou'd draw it from her to any one; and that
was prevented by the suddenness of her exit to t'other
world, which did not give her even time to call Heaven's
mercy on her. And yet now I have said all this,
I own the correspondence and friendship I observe he
holds with your real mother, gives me some suspicion,
and the presents he often makes her (which people seldom
do for nothing) confirm it. But since this is all I can say
to you on that point, pray let us come to the secret,
which you have made me impatient to hear.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Know then, that tho' <em>Cupid</em> is blind, he is not
to be deceived: I can hide my sex from the world but
not from him; his dart has found the way thro' the
manly garb I wear to pierce a virgin's tender heart&mdash;&mdash;I
love&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> How!</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Nay be'nt surpriz'd at that, I have other wonders
for you.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Quick, let me hear 'em.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I love <em>Lorenzo</em>.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> <em>Lorenzo</em>! Most nicely hit. The very man from<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_104" id="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>
whom your imposture keeps this vast estate; and who on
the first knowledge of your being a woman wou'd enter
into possession of it. This is indeed a wonder.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Then wonder still, I am his wife.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Ha! his wife!</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> His wife, <em>Isabella</em>; and yet thou hast not all my
wonders, I am his wife without his knowledge: he does
not even know I am a woman.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Madam, your humble servant; if you please to
go on, I won't interrupt you, indeed I won't.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Then hear how these strange things have past;
<em>Lorenzo</em>, bound unregarded in my sister's chains, seem'd
in my eyes a conquest worth her care. Nor cou'd I
see him treated with contempt, without growing warm
in his interest: I blam'd <em>Leonora</em> for not being touch'd
with his merit; I blam'd her so long, 'till I grew touch'd
with it myself: and the reasons I urg'd to vanquish her
heart, insensibly made a conquest of my own: 'Twas
thus, my friend, I fell. What was next to be done
my passion pointed out; my heart I felt was warm'd
to a noble enterprize, I gave it way, and boldly on
it led me. <em>Leonora</em>'s name and voice, in the dark shades
of night, I borrow'd, to engage the object of my
wishes. I met him, <em>Isabella</em>, and so deceived him; he
cannot blame me sure, for much I blest him. But to
finish this strange story: in short I own, I long had
lov'd, but finding my father most averse to my desires,
I at last had forc'd myself to this secret correspondence;
I urg'd the mischiefs would attend the knowledge on't,
I urg'd them so, he thought them full of weight, so
yielded to observe what rules I gave him: they were,
to pass the day in cold indifference, to avoid even signs
or looks of intimacy, but gather for the still, the secret
night, a flood of love to recompence the losses of the
day. I will not trouble you with lovers cares, nor what
contrivances we form'd to bring this toying to a solid
bliss. Know only, when three nights we thus had
pass'd, the fourth it was agreed should make us one
for ever; each kept their promise, and last night has
join'd us.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> You look as if you were busy, pray tell me if I
interrupt you, I'll retire.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> No, no, you have a right to interrupt us, since
you were the subject of our discourse.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Was I?</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> You were; nay, I'll tell you how you entertain'd
us too.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Perhaps I had as good avoid hearing that.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> You need not fear, it was not to your disadvantage;
I was commending you and saying, if I had been
a woman I had been in danger; nay I think I said I
shou'd infallibly have been in love with you.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> While such an If is in the way, you run no great
risque in declaring; but you'd be finely catch'd now,
shou'd some wonderful transformation give me a claim
to your heart.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Not sorry for't at all, for I ne'er expect to find
a mistress please me half so well as you would do if I
were yours.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Since you are so well inclin'd to me in your
wishes, Sir, I suppose (as the fates have ordain'd it) you
wou'd have some pleasure in helping me to a mistress,
since you can't be mine yourself.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Indeed I shou'd not.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Then my obligation is but small to you.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Why, wou'd you have a woman, that is in
love with you herself, employ her interest to help you to
another?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> No, but you being no woman might.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_106" id="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Sir, 'tis as a woman I say what I do, and I suppose
myself a woman when I design all these favours to
you: therefore out of that supposition, I have no other
good intentions to you than you may expect from one
that says he's&mdash;&mdash;Sir, your humble servant.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> So unless Heaven is pleas'd to work a miracle,
and from a sturdy young fellow, make you a kind-hearted
young lady, I'm to get little by your good opinion
of me.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Yes; there is one means yet left (on this side
a miracle) that wou'd perhaps engage me, if with an
honest oath you could declare, were I woman, I might
dispute your heart even with the first of my pretending
sex.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Then solemnly and honestly I swear, that had you
been a woman, and I the master of the world, I think I
should have laid it at your feet.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Then honestly and solemnly I swear, henceforwards
all your interest shall be mine.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I have a secret to impart to you will quickly try
your friendship.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I've a secret to unfold to you will put you even
to a fiery trial.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> What do you mean, <em>Camillo</em>?</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I mean that I love, where I never durst yet
own it, yet where 'tis in your power to make me the happiest
of&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Explain, <em>Camillo</em>; and be assur'd if your happiness
is in my power, 'tis in your own.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Alas! you promise me you know not what.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I promise nothing but what I will perform; name
the person.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> 'Tis one who is very near to you.</p>

forth the secret?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Mine is not in my power, without the consent of
another.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> 'Tis enough: I will revenge myself this way;
if it does but torment him, I shall be content to find no
other pleasure in it. Brother, you'll wonder at my
change; after all my ill usage of <em>Lorenzo</em>, I am determined
to be his wife.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> How, sister! so sudden a turn? This inequality
of temper indeed is not commendable.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Your change, brother, is much more justly surprizing;
you hitherto have pleaded for him strongly,
accus'd me of blindness, cruelty, and pride; and now I
yield to your reasons, and resolve in his favour, you
blame my compliance, and appear against his interest.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I quit his service for what's dearer to me, yours.
I have learn'd from sure intelligence, the attack he made
on you was but a feint, and that his heart is in another's
chain; I would not therefore see you expos'd, to offer
up yourself to one who must refuse you.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> If that be all, leave me my honour to take care
of; I am no stranger to his wishes, he won't refuse me,
brother, nor I hope will you, to tell him of my resolution:
if you do, this moment with my own tongue
(thro' all the virgin's blushes) I'll own to him I am determin'd
in his favour&mdash;&mdash;You pause as if you'd let the
task lie on me.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Neither on you, nor me; I have a reason you are
yet a stranger to: know then there is a virgin young
and tender, whose peace and happiness so much are
mine, I cannot see her miserable; she loves him with<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_108" id="Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>
that torrent of desire, that were the world resign'd her
in his stead, she'd still be wretched: I will not pique
you to a female strife, by saying you have not charms
to tear him from her; but I would move you to a female
softness, by telling you her death wou'd wait your
conquest. What I have more to plead is as a brother, I
hope that gives me some small interest in you; whate'er
it is, you see how I'd employ it.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> You ne'er cou'd put it to a harder service. I beg
a little time to think: pray leave me to myself a
while.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I shall; I only ask that you wou'd think, and
then you won't refuse me.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit <span class="antiqua">Cam</span>.</em></p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> Indeed, Madam, I'm of your brother's mind,
tho' for another cause; but sure 'tis worth thinking
twice on for your own sake: you are too violent.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> A slighted woman knows no bounds. Vengeance
is all the cordial she can have, so snatches at the
nearest. Ungrateful wretch! to use me with such insolence.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> You see me as much enrag'd at it, as you are
yourself, yet my brain is roving after the cause, for
something there must be: never letter was receiv'd by
man with more passion and transport; I was almost as
charming a goddess as yourself, only for bringing it.
Yet when in a moment after I come with a message worth
a dozen on't, never was witch so handled; something
must have pass'd between one and t'other, that's sure.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Nothing cou'd pass worth my enquiring after,
since nothing cou'd happen that can excuse his usage of
me; he had a letter under my hand which own'd him
master of my heart; and till I contradicted it with my
mouth, he ought not to doubt the truth on't.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> Nay I confess, madam, I han't a word to say
for him, I'm afraid he's a rogue at bottom, as well as
my shameless that attends him; we are bit, by my
troth, and haply well enough serv'd, for list'ning to the
glib tongues of the rascals: but be comforted, Madam;
they'll fall into the hands of some foul sluts or other,
before they die, that will set our account even with e'm.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_109" id="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Well: let him laugh; let him glory in what
he has done: he shall see I have a spirit can use him as
I ought.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> And let one thing be your comfort by the
way, Madam, that in spite of all your dear affections
to him, you have had the grace to keep him at arms
length. You han't thank'd me for't; but good faith
'twas well I did not stir out of the chamber that fond
night. For there are times the stoutest of us are in danger,
the rascals wheedle so.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> In short, my very soul is fir'd with his treatment:
and if ever that perfidious monster should relent, though
he should crawl like a poor worm beneath my feet, nay
plunge a dagger in his heart, to bleed for pardon; I
charge thee strictly, charge thee on thy life, thou do not
urge a look to melt me toward him, but strongly buoy
me up in brave resentment; and if thou see'st (which
heav'ns avert) a glance of weakness in me, rouse to my
memory the vile wrongs I've borne, and blazon them
with skill in all their glaring colours.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> Madam, never doubt me; I'm charged to the
mouth with fury, and if ever I meet that fat traitor of
mine, such a volley will I pour about his ears&mdash;&mdash;Now
heav'n prevent all hasty vows; but in the humour I am,
methinks I'd carry my maiden-head to my cold grave

<p>I'll try if I can discover, by his tutor, what it is that
seems so much to work his brain of late; for something
more than common there plainly does appear, yet nothing
sure that can disturb his soul, like what I have to
torture mine upon his account. Sure nothing in this
world is worth a troubled mind: what racks has avarice
stretch'd me on! I wanted nothing, kind heav'n<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_110" id="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>
had given me a plenteous lot, and seated me in great
abundance; why then approve I of this imposture?
What have I gain'd by it? Wealth and misery. I have
barter'd peaceful days for restless nights; a wretched
bargain! and he that merchandises thus, must be undone
at last.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Metaphrastus</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> <em>Mandatum tuum curo diligenter.</em></p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Master, I had a mind to ask you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> The title, master, comes from <em>Magis</em> and
<em>Ter</em>, which is as much, to say, <em>thrice worthy</em>.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I never heard so much before, but it may be true
for ought I know: but, master&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> Go on.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Why so I will if you'll let me, but don't interrupt
me then.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> Enough, proceed.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Why then, master, for a third time, my son
<em>Camillo</em> gives me much uneasiness of late; you know I
love him, and have many careful thoughts about him.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> 'Tis true. <em>Filio non potest præferri nisi filius.</em></p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Master, when one has business to talk on, these
scholastic expressions are not of use; I believe you a great
Latinist; possibly you may understand <em>Greek</em>: those who
recommended you to me, said so, and I am willing it
should be true: but the thing I want to discourse you
about at present, does not properly give you an occasion
to display your learning. Besides, to tell you truth, 'twill
at all times be lost upon me; my father was a wise man,
but he taught me nothing beyond common sense; I
know but one tongue in the world, which luckily being
understood by you as well as me, I fancy whatever
thoughts we have to communicate to one another, may
reasonably be convey'd in that, without having recourse
to the language of <em>Julius Cæsar</em>.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> You are wrong, but may proceed.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I thank you: what is the matter, I do not know;
but tho' it is of the utmost consequence to me to marry<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_111" id="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span>
my son, what match soever I propose to him, he still
finds some pretence or other to decline it.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> He is, perhaps, of the humour of a brother of
<em>Marcus Tullius</em>, who&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Dear master, leave the <em>Greeks</em>, and the <em>Latins</em>,
and the <em>Scotch</em>, and the <em>Welsh</em>, and let me go on in my
business; what have those people to do with my son's
marriage?</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> Again you are wrong; but go on.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I say then, that I have strong apprehensions from
his refusing all my proposals, that he may have some secret
inclination of his own; and to confirm me in this
fear, I yesterday observed him (without his knowing
it) in a corner of the grove, where nobody comes&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> A place out of the way, you would say; a
place of retreat.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Why, the corner of the grove, where nobody
comes, is a place of retreat, is it not?</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> In <em>Latin</em>, <em>secessus</em>.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Ha!</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> As <em>Virgil</em> has it. <em>Est in secessu locus.</em></p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> How could <em>Virgil</em> have it, when I tell you no
soul was there but he and I?</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> <em>Virgil</em> is a famous author, I quote his saying
as a phrase more proper to the occasion than that you use,
and not as one who was in the wood with you.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> And I tell you, I hope to be as famous as any
<em>Virgil</em> of 'em all, when I have been dead as long, and
have no need of a better phrase than my own to tell you
my meaning.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> You ought however to make choice of the
words most us'd by the best authors. <em>Tu vivendo bonos</em>,
as they say, <em>scribendo sequare peritos</em>.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Again!</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> 'Tis <em>Quintilian</em>'s own precept.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Oons&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> And he hath something very learned upon it,
that may be of service to you to hear.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> You son of a whore, will you hear me speak?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_112" id="Page_112">[Pg 112]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> What may be the occasion of this unmanly
passion? What is it you would have with me?</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> What you might have known an hour ago, if
you had pleas'd.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> You would then have me hold my peace.&mdash;&mdash;I
shall.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> You will do very well.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> You see I do; well, go on.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Why then, to begin once again, I say my son
<em>Camillo</em>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> Proceed; I shan't interrupt you.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I say, my son <em>Camillo</em>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> What is it you say of your son <em>Camillo</em>?</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> That he has got a dog of a tutor, whose brains
I'll beat out, if he won't hear me speak.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> That dog is a philosopher, contemns passion,
and yet will hear you.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I don't believe a word on't, but I'll try once
again; I have a mind to know from you, whether you
have observ'd any thing in my son&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> Nothing that is like his father. Go on.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Have a care.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> I do not interrupt you; but you are long in
coming to a conclusion.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Why, thou hast not let me begin yet.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> And yet 'tis high time to have made an end.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Dost thou know thy danger? I have not&mdash;&mdash;thus
much patience left.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Shewing the end of his finger</em>.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> Mine is already consum'd. I do not use to
be thus treated; my profession is to teach, and not to
hear, yet I have hearken'd like a school-boy, and am
not heard, altho' a master.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Get out of the room.</p>

<p><em>Metaph.</em> I will not. If the mouth of a wise man be
shut, he is, as it were, a fool; for who shall know his
understanding? Therefore a certain philosopher said well,
Speak, that thou may'st be known; great talkers, without
knowledge, are as the winds that whistle; but they
who have learning, should speak aloud. If this be<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_113" id="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span>
not permitted, we may expect to see the whole order of
nature o'erthrown; hens devour foxes, and lambs destroy
wolves, nurses suck children, and children give
suck; generals mend stockings, and chambermaids take
towns; we may expect, I say&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> This thing then being thus happily terminated,

more happy views in the disposal of so fair a daughter<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_117" id="Page_117">[Pg 117]</a></span>
as <em>Leonora</em>, than my poor son's inferior fortune e'er can
answer; but since they are join'd, and that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Ha!</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Nay, 'tis very likely to discourse of it may
not be very pleasing to you, tho' your christianity and
natural goodness have prevail'd on you so generously to
forgive it. But to do justice to <em>Leonora</em>, and skreen her
from your too harsh opinion in this unlucky action, 'twas
that cunning wicked creature that attends her, who by
unusual arts wrought her to this breach of duty, for her
own inclinations were dispos'd to all the modesty and resignation
a father could ask from a daughter; my son
I can't excuse, but since your bounty does so, I hope
you'll quite forget the fault of the less guilty <em>Leonora</em>.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> What a mistake have I lain under here! And
from a groundless apprehension of one misfortune, find
myself in the certainty of another.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p>I don't like this: He went oddly off&mdash;I doubt he
finds this bounty difficult to go through with. His natural
resentment is making an attack upon his acquir'd
generosity: pray heaven it ben't too strong for't. The
misfortune is a great one, and can't but touch him nearly.
It was not natural to be so calm; I wish it don't

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Nothing; no manner of thing in the

always scolding, and finding fault for nothing; complaining
that I have got a coxcomb of a son, that makes
me weary of my life, fancying he perverts the order of
nature, turning day into night, and night into day;
getting whims in my brain, that he consumes his life in
idleness, unless he rouses now and then to do some noble
stroke of mischief; and having an impertinent dream at
this time, that he has been making the fortune of the family,
by an underhand marriage with the daughter of a
man who will crush us all to powder for it. Ah&mdash;&mdash;ungracious
wretch; to bring an old man into all this
trouble! The pain thou gav'st thy mother to bring thee
into the world, and the plague thou hast given me to

<p><em>Lor.</em> I find all's discover'd to my father, the secret's

<p><em>Lop.</em> He knows your marriage. How the pest should
that happen? Sir, 'tis impossible; that's all.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I tell thee 'tis true; he knows every particular of
it.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> He does!&mdash;--Why then, Sir, all I can say is,
that Satan and he are better acquainted than the devil
and a good Christian ought to be.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Which way he has discover'd it I can't tell, nor
am I much concern'd to know, since beyond all my expectations,
I find him perfectly easy at it, and ready to
excuse my fault with better reasons than I can find to do
it myself.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Say you so?&mdash;&mdash;I am very glad to hear that,
then all's safe.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> 'Tis unexpected good fortune; but it could never
proceed purely from his own temper, there must
have been pains taken with him to bring him to this
calm; I'm sure I owe much to the bounty of some friend
or other; I wish I knew where my obligation lay, that I
might acknowledge it as I ought.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Are you thereabout's, I'faith? Then sharp's the
word; I'gad I'll own the thing, and receive his bounty

told him the secret, and then talk'd him into a liking on't.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> 'Tis impossible; thou dost not tell me true.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Sir, I scorn to reap any thing from another man's
labours, but if this poor piece of service carries any merit
with it, you now know where to reward it.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Thou art not serious!</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Look you there again: pray, Sir, be quiet; is

I'gad that last push was within an inch o' me. I don't
know what you make all this bustle about, but I'm sure
I've done all for the best, and I believe it will prove for
the best too at last, if you'll have but a little patience.
But if gentlemen will be in their airs in a moment&mdash;Why,
what the deuce&mdash;&mdash;I'm sure I have been as eloquent
as <em>Cicero</em>, in your behalf; and I don't doubt to good
purpose too, if you'll give things time to work. But nothing
but foul language, and naked swords about the
house, sa, sa; run you through you dog; why, nobody
can do business at this rate.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> And suppose your project fails, and I'm ruin'd
by it, Sir.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Why, 'twill be time enough to kill me then, Sir?
won't it? What should you do it for now? Besides, I
an't ready, I'm not prepar'd, I might be undone by't.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> But what will <em>Leonora</em> say to her marriage being
known, wretch?</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Why may be she'll draw&mdash;&mdash;her sword too.
[<em>Shewing his tongue.</em>] But all shall be well with you both,
if you will but let me alone.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Peace; here's her father.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> That's well: we shall see how things go presently.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Don <span class="antiqua">Alvarez</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> The more I recover from the disorder this discourse
has put me in, the more strange the whole ad<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_121" id="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>venture
appears to me. <em>Leonora</em> maintains there is not a
word of truth in what I have heard; that she knows nothing
of marriage: and indeed she tells me this,
with such a naked air of sincerity, that for my part I believe
her. What then must be their project? Some villainous
intention, to be sure; tho' which way, I yet am
ignorant. But here's the bridegroom; I'll accost him&mdash;&mdash;I
am told, Sir, you take upon you to scandalize
my daughter, and tell idle tales of what can never
happen.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Now methinks, Sir, if you treated your son-in-law
with a little more civility, things might go just as
well in the main.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> What means this insolent fellow by my son-in-law!
I suppose 'tis you, villain, are the author of this
impudent story.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> You seem angry, Sir&mdash;&mdash;perhaps without cause.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Cause, traitor! Is a cause wanting where a
daughter's defam'd, and a noble family scandaliz'd?</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> There he is, let him answer you.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I shou'd be glad, he'd answer me, why, if he
had any desires to my daughter, he did not make his
approaches like a man of honour.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Yes; and so have had the doors bolted against
him like a house-breaker.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Sir to justify my proceeding, I have little to say;
but to excuse it, I have much; if any allowance may
be made to a passion, which in your youth you have
yourself been sway'd by: I love your daughter to that
excess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> You would undo her for a night's lodging.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Undo her, Sir?</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Yes, that's the word; you knew it was against
her interest to marry you, therefore you endeavour'd to
win her to't in private; you knew her friends would
make a better bargain for her, therefore you kept your
designs from their knowledge, and yet you love her to
that excess&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I'd readily lay down my life to serve her.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_122" id="Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Could you readily lay down fifty thousand pistoles
to serve her, your excessive love would come with
better credentials; an offer of life is very proper for the
attack of a counterscarp, but a thousand ducats will
sooner carry a lady's heart; you are a young man, but
will learn this when you are older.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> But since things have succeeded better this once,
Sir, and that my master will prove a most incomparable
good husband (for that he'll do, I'll answer for him) and
that 'tis too late to recall what's already done, Sir&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> What's done, villain?</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Sir, I mean, that since my master and my lady
are marry'd, and&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Thou ly'st; they are not marry'd.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Sir!&mdash;--I say, that since they are marry'd,
and that they love each other so passing dearly, indeed I
fancy that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Why, this impudence is beyond all bearing;
Sir, do you put your rascal upon this?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Sir, I am in a wood; I don't know what it is
you mean.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> And I am in a plain, Sir, and think I may be
understood; do you pretend you are marry'd to my
daughter?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Sir, 'tis my happiness on one side, as it is my
misfortune on another.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> And do you think this idle project can succeed?
do you believe your affirming you are marry'd to her,
will induce both her and me to consent it shall be so?</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Sir, I see you make my master almost out of his
wits to hear you talk so: but I, who am but a stande-by
now, as I was at the wedding, have mine about me,
and desire to know, whether you think this project can
succeed? Do you believe your affirming they are not
marry'd, will induce both him and I to give up the
lady? One short question to bring this matter to an issue,
Why do you think they are not marry'd?</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Because she utterly renounces it.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> And so she will her religion, if you attack it
with that dreadful face. D'ye hear, Sir? the poor lady<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_123" id="Page_123">[Pg 123]</a></span>
is in love heartily, and I wish all poor ladies that are so,
would dispose of themselves so well as she has done; but
you scare her out of her senses: bring her here into the
room, speak gently to her, tell her you know the thing
is done, that you have it from a man of honour, Me.
That may be you wish it had been otherwise, but are a
Christian, and profess mercy, and therefore have resolved
to pardon her: say this, and I shall appear a man of reputation,
and have satisfaction made me.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Or an impudent rogue, and have all your bones
broke.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Content.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Agreed, <em>Leonora</em>! who's there? call <em>Leonora</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> All will go rarely, Sir; we shall have shot the
gulf in a moment.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Come hither, <em>Leonora</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> So, now we shall see.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> I call'd you to answer for yourself; here's a
strong claim upon you; if there be any thing in the
pretended title, conceal it no farther, it must be known
at last, it may as well be so now. Nothing is so uneasy
as uncertainty, I would therefore be gladly freed from
it: if you have done what I am told you have, 'tis a
great fault indeed; but as I fear 'twill carry much of its
punishment along with it, I shall rather reduce my resentment
into mourning your misfortune, than suffer it to
add to your affliction; therefore speak the truth.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Well, this is fair play; now I speak, Sir: you
see, fair lady, the goodness of a tender father, nothing
need therefore hinder you from owning a most loving
husband. We had like to have been altogether by the
ears about this business, and pails of blood were ready
to run about the house: but, thank heaven, the sun
shines out again, and one word from your sweet mouth
makes fair weather for ever. My master has been forc'd
to own your marriage, he begs you'll do so too.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> What does this impudent rascal mean?</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Ha!&mdash;--Madam!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_124" id="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Sir, I should be very glad to know [<em>To <span class="antiqua">Lorenzo</span>.</em>]

<p><em>Lop.</em> He, he&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Forgive me, dear <em>Leonora</em>, I know you had strong

<p><em>Lor.</em> 'Tis known, my dear, tho' much against my will;
but since it is so, 'twou'd be in vain for us to deny it
longer.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Then, Sir, I am your wife? I fell in love with
you, and married you without my father's knowledge?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I dare not be so vain to think 'twas love; I
humbly am content to owe the blessing to your generosity;
you saw the pains I suffer'd for your sake, and in
compassion eas'd 'em.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> I did, Sir! Sure this exceeds all human impudence.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Truly, I think it does. She'd make an incomparable
actress.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I begin to be surpris'd, Madam, at you carrying
this thing so far; you see there's no occasion for it; and
for the discovery, I have already told you, 'twas not my
fault.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> My master's! no, 'twas I did it: why, what a
bustle's here! I knew things would go well, and so they
do, if folks would let 'em. But if ladies will be in
their merriments, when gentlemen are upon serious business,
why what a deuce can one say to 'em?</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> I see this fellow is to be an evidence in your plot;
where you hope to drive, it is hard to guess; for if any
thing can exceed its impudence, it is its folly. A noble
stratagem indeed to win a lady by! I could be diverted
with it, but that I see a face of villainy requires a
rougher treatment; I could almost, methinks, forget my
sex, and be my own avenger.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Madam, I am surpris'd beyond all&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Pray, Sir, let me come to her; you are so surpris'd,
you'll make nothing on't: she wants a little snub<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_125" id="Page_125">[Pg 125]</a></span>bing.
Look you, madam, I have seen many a pleasant
humour amongst ladies, but you out-cut them all. Here's
contradiction, with a vengeance: you han't been married
eight-and-forty hours, and you are slap&mdash;&mdash;at your
husband's beard already: why, do you consider who he
is?&mdash;&mdash;Who this gentleman is? And what he can do&mdash;&mdash;by

<p><em>Cam.</em> Ah <em>Isabella</em>! Fate has now determin'd

the dispute is too monstrous to pass over, without further
enquiry, which must discover all, and what will be
the consequence, I tremble at: for whether Don <em>Alvarez</em>
knows of the imposture, or whether he is deceiv'd,
with the rest of the world, when once it breaks out, and
the consequence is the loss of that great wealth he now
enjoys by it, what must become of me? All paternal
affections then must cease, and regarding me as an unhappy
instrument in the trouble which will then o'erload
him, he will return me to my humble birth, and
then I'm lost for ever. For what, alas! will the deceiv'd
<em>Lorenzo</em> say? A wife with neither fortune, birth,
nor beauty, instead of one most plenteously endow'd
with all. O heavens! what a sea of misery I have before
me!</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Indeed you reason right, but these reflections are
ill-tim'd; why did you not employ them sooner?</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Because I lov'd.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> And don't you do so now?</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I do, and therefore 'tis I make these cruel just
reflections.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> So that love, I find, can do any thing.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Indeed it can: its powers are wondrous great,
its pains no tongue can tell, its bliss no heart conceive,
crowns cannot recompense its torments, heaven scarce
supplies its joys. My stake is of this value: oh counsel
me how I shall save it.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Alas! that counsel's much beyond my wisdom's
force, I see no way to help you.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> And yet 'tis sure there's one.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> What?</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Death.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> There possibly may be another; I have thought
this moment&mdash;&mdash;perhaps there's nothing in it; yet a
small passage comes to my remembrance, that I regarded
little when it happen'd&mdash;&mdash;I'll go and search for one

but disturb us now, let us avoid him.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Repuls'd again! this is not to be borne. What
tho' this villain's story be a falshood, was I to blame
to hearken to it? This usage cannot be supported: how
was it she treated thee?</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Never was ambassador worse receiv'd. Madam,
my master asks ten thousand pardons, and humbly begs
one moment's interview:&mdash;&mdash;Begone, you rascal you.
Madam, what answer shall I give my Master?&mdash;&mdash;Tell
him he's a villain. Indeed, fair lady, I think this is
hasty treatment&mdash;Here, my footmen, toss me this fellow
out at the window; and away she went to her devotions.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Did you see <em>Jacinta</em>?</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Yes; she saluted me with half a score rogues and
rascals too. I think our destinies are much alike, Sir;
and o'my conscience, a couple of scurvy jades we are
hamper'd with.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Ungrateful woman, to receive with such contempt
so quick a return of a heart so justly alarm'd.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> What, no allowance to be made to the first transports
of a lover's fury, when rous'd by so dreadful an
appearance? as just as my suspicions were, have I long
suffer'd them to arraign her?</p>

<p><em>San.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Have I waited for oaths or imprecations to clear
her?</p>

<p><em>San.</em> No.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Nay, even now is not the whole world still in
suspense about her? whilst I alone conclude her innocent.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> 'Tis very true.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> She might, methinks, thro' this profound respect,
observe a flame another would have cherish'd:
she might support me against groundless fears, and save
me from a rival's tyranny; she might release me from
these cruel racks, and would, no doubt, if she cou'd love
as I do.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Ha, ha, ha.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> But since she don't, what do I whining here?
Curse on the base humilities of love.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_129" id="Page_129">[Pg 129]</a></span></p>

<p><em>San.</em> Right.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Let children kiss the rod that fleas them, let dogs
lie down and lick the shoe that spurns them.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Ay.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> I am a man by nature meant for power; the
scepter's given us to wield, and we betray our trust
whenever we meanly lay it at a woman's feet.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> True, we are men, boo&mdash;&mdash;Come, Master, let
us both be in a passion; here's my scepter, [<em>Shewing a
cudgel.</em>] Subject <em>Jacinta</em>, look about you. Sir, was you
ever in <em>Muscovy</em>? the women there love the men dearly;
why? because&mdash;&mdash;[<em>Shaking his stick.</em>] there's your love-powder
for you. Ah, Sir, were we but wise and stout,
what work should we make with them! But this humble
love-making, spoils them all. A rare way indeed to
bring matters about with them; we are persuading them
all day they are angels and Goddesses, in order to use
them at night like human creatures; we are like to
succeed truly.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> For my part I never yet could bear a slight from
any thing, nor will I now. There's but one way however
to resent it from a woman: and that's to drive her
bravely from your heart, and place a worthier in her
vacant throne.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Now, with submission to my betters, I have another
way, Sir, I'll drive my tyrant from my heart,
and place myself in her throne. Yes; I will be lord
of my own tenement, and keep my household in order.
Wou'd you wou'd do so too, Master; for look
you, I have been servitor in a college at <em>Salamanca</em>, and
read philosophy with the doctors; where I found that
a woman, in all times, has been observed to be an animal
hard to understand, and much inclined to mischief.
Now as an animal is always an animal, and a captain
always a captain, so a woman is always a woman:
whence it is, that a certain <em>Greek</em> says, her head is like
a bank of sand; or, as another, a solid rock; or, according
to a third, a dark lanthorn. Pray, Sir, observe,
for this is close reasoning; and so as the head is the
head of the body; and that the body without a head,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_130" id="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>
is like a head without a tail; and that where there is
neither head nor tail, 'tis a very strange body: so I
say a woman is by comparison, do you see, (for nothing
explains things like comparisons) I say by comparison,
as <em>Aristotle</em> has often said before me, one may compare
her to the raging sea; for as the sea, when the wind
rises, knits its brows like an angry bull, and that waves
mount upon rocks, and rocks mount upon waves:
that porpusses leap like trouts, and whales skip about
like gudgeons; that ships roll like beer-barrels, and
mariners pray like saints; just so, I say a woman&mdash;&mdash;A
woman, I say, just so, when her reason is ship-wreck'd
upon her passion, and the hulk of her understanding
lies thumping against the rock of her fury; then it is,
I say, that by certain immotions, which&mdash;&mdash;um cause,
as one may suppose, a sort of convulsive&mdash;&mdash;yes&mdash;&mdash;hurricanious&mdash;&mdash;um&mdash;&mdash;like&mdash;&mdash;in
short, a woman is like the Devil.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> Admirably reason'd indeed, <em>Sancho</em>.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Pretty well, I thank Heaven; but here come the
crocodiles to weep us into mercy.</p>

<p>Master, let us shew ourselves men, and leave their briny
tears to wash their dirty faces.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> It is not in the power of charms to move me.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Nor me, I hope; and yet I fear those eyes will
look out sharp to snatch up such a prize.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Pointing to <span class="antiqua">Jacinta</span>.</em></p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> That's brave.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> You look, Madam, upon me, as if you thought
I came to trouble you with my usual importunities; I'll
ease you of that pain, by telling you my business now
is calmly to assure you, but I assure it you with Heaven
and hell for seconds; for may the joys of one fly from
me, whilst the pains of t'other overtake me, if all your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_131" id="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span>

<p><em>San.</em> Bon.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> You are a man of that nice honour, Sir, I know
you'll keep your word: I expected this assurance from
you, and came this way only to thank you for't.</p>

<p><em>Jacin.</em> Very well.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> You did, imperious dame, you did: how base is
woman's pride! How wretched are the ingredients it is
form'd of! If you saw cause for just disdain, why did
you not at first repulse me? Why lead a slave in chains,
that could not grace your triumphs? If I am thus to be
contemn'd, think on the favours you have done the
wretch, and hide your face for ever.</p>

<p><em>San.</em> Well argued.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> I own you have hit the only fault the world can
charge me with: the favours I have done to you, I am
indeed asham'd of; but since women have their frailties,
you'll allow me mine.</p>

<p><em>Car.</em> 'Tis well, extremely well, Madam. I'm happy
however, you at last speak frankly. I thank you for it:
from my soul I thank you: but don't expect me groveling
at your feet again; don't, for if I do&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> You will be treated as you deserve; trod upon.</p>

by heavens I wish you so, but never spread your net for

be torn with pincers bit from bit; rather be broil'd
like martyrs upon gridirons&mdash;&mdash;But I am wrong; this
sounds like passion, and heaven can tell I am not angry:

it cost me my life, I'll enter <em>Leonora</em>'s lodgings;
therefore make haste, <em>Lopez</em>, prepare every thing necessary,
three pair of pocket pistols, two wide-mouth'd
blunderbusses, some six ells of sword-blade and a couple
of dark lanthorns. When my Master said this to
me; Sir, said I to my master, (that is, I would have
said it, if I had not been in such a fright, I could say
nothing, however I'll say it to him now, and shall probably
have a quiet hearing;) look you, Sir, by dint
of reason I intend to confound you: you are resolv'd,
you say, to get into <em>Leonora</em>'s lodgings, tho' the Devil
stand in the door-way?&mdash;&mdash;Yes, <em>Lopez</em>, that's my
resolution&mdash;&mdash;Very well, and what do you intend
to do when you are there?&mdash;&mdash;Why, what an injur'd
man shou'd do; make her sensible of&mdash;&mdash;Make her
sensible of a pudding, don't you see she's a jade? She'll
raise the house about your ears, arm the whole family,
set the great dog at you.&mdash;&mdash;Were there legions of
Devils to repulse me, in such a cause I could disperse
them all&mdash;&mdash;Why then you have no occasion for
help, Sir, you may leave me at home to lay the cloth.&mdash;&mdash;No;
thou art my ancient friend, my fellow-traveller,
and to reward thy faithful services, this night
thou shalt partake my danger and my glory.&mdash;&mdash;Sir, I
have got glory enough under you already, to content
any reasonable servant for his life&mdash;&mdash;Thy modesty
makes me willing to double my bounty; this night may<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_137" id="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span>
bring eternal honour to thee and thy family.&mdash;&mdash;Eternal
honour, Sir, is too much in conscience for a
serving-man; besides ambition has been many a great
soul's undoing&mdash;&mdash;I doubt thou art afraid, my <em>Lopez</em>,
thou shalt be arm'd with back, with breast and headpiece&mdash;&mdash;They
will encumber me in my retreat.&mdash;&mdash;Retreat!
my hero! Thou never shalt retreat.&mdash;&mdash;Then
by my troth I'll never go, Sir.&mdash;&mdash;But here
he comes.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Will it never be night? sure 'tis the longest day
the sun e'er travell'd.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Would 'twere as long as those in <em>Greenland</em>, Sir,
that you might spin out your life t'other half year. I
don't like these nightly projects; a man can't see what
he does: we shall have some scurvy mistake or other
happen; a brace of bullets blunder thro' your head in
the dark perhaps, and spoil all your intrigue.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Away, you trembling wretch, away.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Nay, Sir, what I say is purely for your safety:
for as to myself&mdash;&mdash;Uds-death, I no more value the
losing a quart of blood, than I do drinking a quart of
wine. Besides, my veins are too full, my physician
advis'd me yesterday to let go twenty ounces for my
health. So you see, Sir, there's nothing of that in the
case.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Then let me hear no other objections: for 'till I
see <em>Leonora</em> I must lie upon the rack. I cannot bear her
resentment, and will pacify her this night, or not live
to see to-morrow.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Well, Sir, since you are so determin'd, I shan't
be impertinent with any farther advice; but I think you
have laid your design to&mdash;&mdash;[<em>He coughs.</em>] (I have got
such a cold to-day) to get in privately, have you not?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Yes; and have taken care to be introduced as far
as her chamber-door with all secrecy.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> [<em>He coughs.</em>]&mdash;&mdash;This unlucky cough, I had
rather have had a fever at another time. Sir, I should
be sorry to do you more harm than good upon this oc<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_138" id="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span>casion:
if this cough shou'd come upon me in the midst
of the action, [<em>Coughs.</em>] and give the alarm to the family,
I shou'd not forgive myself as long as I liv'd.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I have greater ventures than that to take my
chance for, and can't dispense with your attendance, Sir.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> This 'tis to be a good servant, and make one's
self necessary.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Toledo</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> Sir,&mdash;&mdash;I am glad I have found you. I am a
man of honour, you know, and do always profess
losing my life upon a handsome occasion: sir, I come to
offer you my service. I am inform'd from unquestionable
hands, that Don <em>Carlos</em> is enrag'd against you to a dangerous
degree; and that old <em>Alvarez</em> has given positive
directions to break the legs and arms of your servant
<em>Lopez</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Look you there, now, I thought what 'twou'd
come to; what do they meddle with me for? What have
I to do in my Master's amours? The old Don's got out of
his senses, I think, have I married his daughter?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Fear nothing, we'll take care o'thee&mdash;&mdash;Sir, I
thank you for the favour of your intelligence, 'tis nothing
however but what I have expected and am provided for.</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> Sir, I wou'd advise you to provide yourself with
good friends, I desire the honour to keep your back hand
myself.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> 'Tis very kind indeed. Pray, Sir, have you never
a servant with you cou'd hold a racket for me too?</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> I have two friends fit to head two armies; and
yet&mdash;&mdash;a word in your ear, they shan't cost you above a
ducat a-piece.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Take 'em by all means, Sir, you were never
offer'd a better pennyworth in your life.</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> Ah, Sir,&mdash;&mdash;little <em>Diego</em>&mdash;&mdash;you have heard
of him; he'd have been worth a legion upon this occasion:
you know, I suppose, how they have serv'd
him&mdash;&mdash;They have hang'd him, but he made a noble
execution; they clapp'd the rack and the priest
to him at once, but cou'd neither get a word of con<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_139" id="Page_139">[Pg 139]</a></span>fession,
nor a groan of repentance; he died mighty well
truly.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Such a man is indeed much to be regretted: As
for the rest of your escorte, captain, I thank you for 'em,
but shall not use 'em.</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> I'm sorry for't, Sir, because I think you go in
very great danger; I'm much afraid your rival won't
give you fair play.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> If he does, I'll be hang'd; he's a damn'd passionate
fellow, and cares not what mischief he does.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I shall give him a very good opportunity: for
I'll have no other guards about me but you, Sir. So
come along.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Why, Sir, this is the sin of presumption; setting
heaven at defiance, making a Jack-pudding of a
blunderbuss.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> No more, but follow. Hold! turn this way;
I see <em>Camillo</em> there. I wou'd avoid him, 'till I see what
part he takes in this odd affair of his sister's. For I
wou'd not have the quarrel fix'd with him, if it be possible
to avoid it.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit <span class="antiqua">Lorenzo</span>.</em></p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Sir&mdash;&mdash;Captain <em>Toledo</em>, one word if you
please, Sir; I'm mighty sorry to see my Master won't
accept of your friendly offer; look ye, I'm not very
rich; but as far as the expences of a dollar went, if you'd
be so kind to take a little care of me, it shou'd be at
your service.</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> Let me see:&mdash;&mdash;A dollar you say? but suppose
I'm wounded?</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Why you shall be put to no extraordinary charge
upon that: I have been 'prentice to a barber; and will
be your surgeon myself.</p>

<p><em>Tol.</em> 'Tis too cheap in conscience; but my land estate
is ill paid this war-time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> That a little industry may be commendable; so
say no more, that matter's fix'd.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> How miserable a perplexity have I brought myself
into! Yet why do I complain? since with all the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_140" id="Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span>
dreadful torture I endure, I can't repent of one wild
step I've made. O Love! what tempests canst thou raise,
what storms canst thou assuage! To all thy cruelties I am
resign'd: Long years thro' seas of torment I'm content
to roll, so thou wilt guide me to the happy port of my
<em>Lorenzo</em>'s arms, and bless me there with one calm day at
last.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Isabella</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> What news, dear <em>Isabella</em>? methinks there's
something chearful in your looks may give a trembling
lover hopes. If you have comfort for me, speak, for I
indeed have need of it.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Were your wants yet still greater than they are,
I bring a plentiful supply.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> O Heav'ns! is it possible?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> New mysteries are out, and if you can find
charms to wean <em>Lorenzo</em> from your sister, no other obstacle
is in the way to all your wish.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Kind messenger from Heaven, speak on.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Know then, that you are daughter to <em>Alvarez</em>.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> How! daughter to <em>Alvarez</em>?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> You are: The truth this moment's come to
light; and till this moment he, altho' your father, was
a stranger to it; nay, did not even know you were a
woman. In short, the great estate, which has occasion'd
these uncommon accidents, was left but on condition
of a son; great hopes of one there was, when
you destroy'd 'em, and to your parents came a most unwelcome
guest: To repair the disappointment, you
were exchang'd for that young <em>Camillo</em>, who few months
after dy'd. Your father then was absent, but your mother
quick in contrivance, bold in execution, during
that infant's sickness, had resolv'd his death shou'd not
deprive her family of those advantages his life had given
it; so order'd things with such dexterity, that once
again there past a change between you: of this (for
reasons yet unknown to me) she made a secret to her
husband, and took such wise precautions, that 'till this<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_141" id="Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span>
hour 'twas so to all the world, except the person from
whom I now have heard it.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> This news indeed affords a view of no unhappy
termination; yet there are difficulties still may be of
fatal hindrance.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> None, except that one I just now nam'd to you;
for to remove the last, know I have already unfolded
all, both to Alvarez and Don Felix.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> And how have they receiv'd it?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> To your wishes both. As for <em>Lorenzo</em>, he is yet
a stranger to all has past, and the two old fathers desire
he may some moments longer continue so. They have
agreed to be a little merry with the heat he is in, and engage
you in a family-quarrel with him.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I doubt, <em>Isabella</em>, I shall act that part but
faintly.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> No matter, you'll make amends for it in the
scene of reconciliation.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Pray heaven it be my lot to act it with him.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> Here comes Don <em>Felix</em> to wish you joy.</p>

and 'tis a mettled action thou hast done; if <em>Lorenzo</em> don't
like thee the better for't, Cods my life, he's a pitiful
fellow, and I shan't believe the bonny old man had the
getting of him.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> I'm so encourag'd by your forgiveness, Sir, methinks
I have some flattering hopes of his.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Of his! I'gad, and he had best, I believe he'll
meet with his match if he don't. What dost think of
trying his courage a little, by way of a joke or so?</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> I was just telling her your design, Sir.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Why I'm in a mighty witty way upon this
whimsical occasion; but I see him coming. You must
not appear yet; go your way in to the rest of the people
there, and I'll inform him what a squabble he has
work'd himself into here.</p>

</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Pray, Sir, don't be so obstinate now, don't affront
Heaven at this rate. I had a vision last night about
this business on purpose to forwarn you; I dreamt
of goose-eggs, a blunt knife, and the snuff of a candle;
I'm sure there's mischief towards.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> You cowardly rascal, hold your tongue.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> <em>Lorenzo</em>, come hither, my boy, I was just
going to send for thee. The honour of our ancient family
lies in thy hands; there is a combat preparing,
thou must fight, my son.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Look you there, now, did not I tell you? O
dreams are wond'rous things, I never knew that snuff of
a candle fail yet.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Sir, I do not doubt but <em>Carlos</em> seeks my life, I
hope he'll do it fairly.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Fairly, do you hear, fairly! Give me leave to
tell you, Sir, folks are not fit to be trusted with lives,
that don't know how to look better after them. Sir, you
gave it him, I hope you'll make him take a little more
care on't.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> My care shall be to make him do as a man
of honour ought to do.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> What, will you let him fight, then? let your own
flesh and blood fight?</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> In a good cause, as this is.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> <em>O monstrum horrendum!</em> Now I have that humanity
about me, that if a man but talks to me of fighting,
I shiver at the name on't.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> What you do, on this occasion Sir, is worthy of
you: And had I been wanting to you, in my due regards
before, this noble action wou'd have stamp'd that impression,
which a grateful son ought to have for so generous
a father.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Very generous, truly! gives him leave to be run
thro' the guts, for his posterity to brag on a hundred
years hence.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I think, Sir, as things now stand, it won't be
right for me to wait for <em>Carlos</em>'s call; I'll, if you please,
prevent him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_143" id="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Ay, pray, Sir, do prevent him by all means, 'tis
better made up, as you say, a thousand times.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Hold your tongue, you impertinent Jackanapes,
I will have him fight, and fight like a fury too;
If he don't, he'll be worsted, I can tell him that. For
know, son, your antagonist is not the person you name,
it is an enemy of twice his force.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> O dear, O dear, O dear! and will nobody keep
'em asunder?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Nobody shall keep us asunder, if once I know the
man I have to deal with.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Thy man then is&mdash;&mdash;<em>Camillo</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> <em>Camillo!</em></p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> 'Tis he, he'll suffer no body to decide this
quarrel but himself.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Then there are no seconds, Sir.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> None.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> He's a brave man.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> No, he says nobody's blood shall be spilt
upon this occasion, but theirs who have a title to it.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> I believe he'll scarce have a law-suit upon the
claim.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> In short, he accuses thee of a shameful falshood,
in pretending his sister <em>Leonora</em> was thy wife; and
has upon it prevailed with his father, as thou has done
with thine, to let the debate be ended by the sword
'twixt him and thee.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> And pray, Sir, with submission, one short question
if you please; what may the gentle <em>Leonora</em> say of
this business?</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> She approves of the combat, and marries
<em>Carlos</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Why, God a-mercy.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Is it possible? Sure she's a devil, not a woman.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> I&mdash;&mdash;cod, Sir, the Devil and a woman both,
I think.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> Well, thou sha't have satisfaction of some of
'em. Here they all come.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> Well, Don <em>Felix</em>, have you prepared your son?
for mine, he's ready to engage.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> And so is his. My wrongs prepare me for a
thousand combats. My hand has hitherto been held by
the regard I've had to every thing of kin to <em>Leonora</em>; but
since the monstrous part she acts has driven her from my
heart, I call for reparation from her family.</p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> You'll have it, Sir; <em>Camillo</em> will attend you instantly.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> O lack! O lack! will no body do a little something
to prevent bloodshed? Why, Madam, have you no pity,
no bowels? [<em>To <span class="antiqua">Leonora</span>.</em>] stand and see one of your husbands
stoter'd before your face? 'Tis an arrant shame.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> If widowhood be my fate, I must bear it as I
can.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Why, did you ever hear the like?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Talk to her no more. Her monstrous impudence
is no otherwise to be replied to, than by a dagger
in her brother's heart.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Yonder he's coming to receive it. But have a
care, brave Sir, he does not place it in another's.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> It is not in his power. He has a rotten cause
upon his sword, I'm sorry he's engag'd in't; but since
he is, he must take his fate. For you, my bravo, expect
me in your turn.</p>

nothing will serve her but the blood either of a husband

into my fatal hand, hear me, <em>Camillo</em>; hear <em>Alvarez</em>;
all! I imprecate the utmost powers of heaven to shower

eternal anguish, if wicked <em>Leonora</em> ben't my wife.</p>

<p><em>Omnes.</em> O Lord, O Lord, O Lord!</p>

wrap me in their everlasting pains, if ever once I had a
fleeting thought of making him my husband.</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> O Lord, O Lord, O Lord!</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> Nay more; to strike him dumb at once, and shew
what men with honest looks can practise, know he's
married to another.</p>

<p><em>Leo.</em> The truth of this is known to some here.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Kneels and lets her perriwig fall off.</em></p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> A woman!</p>

<p><em>Lop.</em> Ay&mdash;&mdash;cod, and a pretty one too; you wags you.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> I'm all amazement. Rise, <em>Camillo</em>, (if I am still to
call you by that name) and let me hear the wonders you
have for me.</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> That part her modesty will ask from me: I'm to
inform you then, that this disguise hides other mysteries
besides a woman; a large and fair estate was cover'd
by it, which with the lady now will be resigned
to you. 'Tis true, in justice it was yours before; but 'tis
the God of Love has done you right. To him you owe
this strange discovery, thro' him you are to know the true
<em>Camillo</em>'s dead, and that this fair adventurer is daughter
to <em>Alvarez</em>.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Incredible! but go on; let me hear more.</p>

<p>Don <em>Fel.</em> She'll tell thee the rest herself, the next dark
night she meets thee in the garden.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Ha!&mdash;Was it <em>Camillo</em> then, that I&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Isab.</em> It was <em>Camillo</em> who there made you happy: And
who has virtue, beauty, wit and love&mdash;&mdash;enough to
make you so, while life shall last you.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> The proof she gives me of her love, deserves a
large acknowledgment indeed. Forgive me therefore,
<em>Leonora</em>, if what I owe this goodness and these charms, I
with my utmost care, my life, my soul, endeavour to repay.</p>

<p><em>Cam.</em> Is it then possible you can forgive me?</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> Indeed I can; few crimes have such a claim to
mercy; but join with me then, dear <em>Camillo</em>, (for still I
know you by no other name) join with me to obtain
your father's pardon: yours, <em>Leonora</em>, too, I must implore;
and yours, my friend, for now we may be such.
[<em>To <span class="antiqua">Carlos</span>.</em>] Of all I ask forgiveness. And since there
is so fair a cause of all my wild mistakes, I hope I by her
interest shall obtain it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_147" id="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Alv.</em> You have a claim to mine, <em>Lorenzo</em>, I wish I had
so strong a one to yours; but if by future services, (tho'
I lay down my life amongst 'em) I may blot out of your
remembrance a fault (I cannot name) I then shall leave
the world in peace.</p>

<p><em>Lor.</em> In peace then, Sir, enjoy it; for from this very
hour, whate'er is past with me, is gone for ever. Your
daughter is too fair a mediatrix to be refus'd his pardon,
to whom she owes the charms she pleads with for it.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Erastus</span> and his man, with <span class="antiqua">Lisetta</span>, <span class="antiqua">Mariamne</span>'s maid.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> <span class="smcap"><span class="fauxcap">O</span>nce</span> more I tell ye, Sir, if you have any
consideration in the world for her, you must
be gone this minute.</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> My dear <em>Lisetta</em>, let me but speak to her, let me
but see her only.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> You may do what you will; but not here, whilst
you are in our house. I do believe she's as impatient to
see you, as you can be to see her; but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> But why won't you give us that satisfaction then?</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Because I know the consequence; for when you
once get together, the Devil himself is not able to part
you; you will stay so long 'till you are surpriz'd, and
what will become of us then?</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> Why, then we shall be thrown out at the window,
I suppose.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> No, but I shall be turn'd out of doors.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_152" id="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Er.</em> How unfortunate am I! these doors are open to
all the world, and only shut to me.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Because you come for a wife, and at our house
we do not care for people that come for wives.</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> What would you have us come for, child?</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Any thing but wives; because they cannot be
put off without portions.</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> Portions! No, no, never talk of portions; my
Master nor I neither don't want portions; and if he'd
follow my advice, a regiment of fathers shou'd not guard
her.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> What say you?</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> Why, if you'll contrive that my Master may run
away with your Mistress, I don't much care, faith, if I
run away with you.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Don't you so, rogue's face? but I hope to be
better provided for.</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> Hold your tongues. But where is <em>Mariamne</em>'s
brother? He is my bosom friend, and would be willing
to serve me.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> I told you before, that he has been abroad a
hunting, and we han't seen him these three days; he
seldom lies at home, to avoid his father's ill humour; so
that it is not your Mistress only that our old covetous
cuff teizes&mdash;&mdash;there's nobody in the family but feels the
effects of his ill humour&mdash;&mdash;by his good will he would
not suffer a creature to come within his doors, or eat at
his table&mdash;&mdash;and if there be but a rabbit extraordinary
for dinner, he thinks himself ruin'd for ever.</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> Then I find you pass your time comfortably in
this family.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Not so bad as you imagine neither, perhaps; for,
thank Heaven, we have a Mistress that's as bountiful as
he is stingy, one that will let him say what he will, and
yet does what she will. But hark, here's somebody
coming; it is certainly he.</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> Can't you hide us somewhere?</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Here, here, get you in here as fast as you can.</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> Thrust me in too.</p>

looking for you all over the house: who are those people
in the garden with my mother-in-law? I believe my
father won't be very well pleas'd to see 'em there.</p>

on't this time; you must do your work with a jirk&mdash;&mdash;one

and I'll stand centry for you in the mean time.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Do you know what you expose me to, <em>Erastus</em>?
What do you mean?</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> To die, Madam, since you receive me with so
little pleasure.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Consider what wou'd become of me, if my father
shou'd see you here.</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> What wou'd you have me do?</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Expect with patience some happy turn of affairs;
my mother-in-law is kind and indulgent to a
miracle, and her favour, if well managed, may turn to
our advantage; and cou'd I prevail upon myself to declare
my passion to her, I don't doubt but she'd join in
our interest.</p>

<p><em>Er.</em> Well, since we've nothing to fear from her, and
your brother, you know is my intimate friend; you
may therefore conceal me somewhere about the house
for a few days. I'll creep into any hole.</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> Ay, but who must have the care of bringing us
victuals?</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Er.</em> Thrust us into the cellar, or up into the garret:<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_154" id="Page_154">[Pg 154]</a></span>
I don't care where it is, so that it be but under the same
roof with you.</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> But I don't say so, for that jade <em>Lisetta</em> will have
the feeding of us, and I know what kind of diet she keeps&mdash;&mdash;I
believe we shan't be like the fox in the fable, our
bellies won't be so full but we shall be able to creep out
at the same hole we got in at.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Begone this minute.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> Hold, Sir, I'd rather see you angry than her,

and two as dainty deames as a man wou'd desire to lay
his lips to.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> And all this crew sets up at my house.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> Noa, noa, Measter, the coachman is gone into
the village to set up his coach at some inn, for I told
him our coach-house was vull of vaggots, but he'll bring
back the six horses, for I told him we had a rear good

they here? But who are they?</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Why, Sir, there's the fat Abbot that always sits
so long at dinner, and drinks his two bottles by way of
whet.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> I wish his church was in his belly, that his
guts might be half full before he came&mdash;&mdash;and who else?</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Then there's the merry Lady that's always in a

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Very well.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Then there's she that threw down all my Lady's
china t'other day, and laugh'd at it for a jest.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Which I paid above fifty pounds for in

all this fine company?&mdash;&mdash;With a hearty welcome, and
a courtsy with her bum down to the ground, ha.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> No indeed, Sir, she was very angry with 'em.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> How, angry with 'em, say you?</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Yes indeed, Sir, for she expected they wou'd
have staid here a fortnight, but it seems things happen
so unluckily that they can't stay here above ten days.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Ten days! How! what! four persons

before your face.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Can I help it, brother? But what's the
matter now?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> There's a parcel of fellows have been hunting
about your grounds all this morning, broke down your<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_158" id="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span>
hedges, and are now coming into your house&mdash;&mdash;don't
you hear them?</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> No, no, I don't hear them: who are they?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> Three or four rake-helly officers, with your nephew
at the head of 'em.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> O the rogue! he might well send me fowls&mdash;&mdash;but
is it not a vexatious thing, that I must stand
still and see myself plunder'd at this rate, and have a
carrion of a wife who thinks I ought to thank all these
rogues that come to devour me! but can't you advise me
what's to be done in this case?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> I wish I cou'd; for it goes to my heart to see
you thus treated by a crew of vermin, who think they do
you a great deal of honour in ruining of you.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Can there be no way found to redress this?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> If I were you, I'd leave this house quite, and go
to town.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> What, and leave my wife behind me? ay
that wou'd be mending the matter indeed!</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> Why don't you sell it then?</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Because nobody will buy it; it has got as
bad a name as if the plague were in't; it has been sold
over and over, and every family that has liv'd in it has
been ruin'd.</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> Then send away all your beds and furniture; except
what is absolutely necessary for your own family,
you'll save something by that, for then your guests can't
stay with you all night, however.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> I've try'd that already, and it signified nothing&mdash;&mdash;For
they all got drunk and lay in the barn,
and next morning laugh'd it off for a frolick.</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> Then there is but one remedy left that I can
think of.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> What's that?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> You must e'en do what's done when a town's on
fire, blow up your house that the mischief may run no farther&mdash;&mdash;But

<p><em>Griff.</em> There is but one way to get rid of this plague,
and that is, as I told you before, to set your house on
fire.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> That's doing myself an injury, not them.</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> There's dogs, horses, masters and servants, all
intend to stay here 'till to-morrow morning, that they
may be near the woods to hunt the earlier&mdash;besides (I
overheard them) they're in a kind of plot against you.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> What did they say?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> You'll be angry if I tell ye.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Can I be more angry than I am?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> They said then that it was the greatest pleasure
in the world to ruin an old lawyer in the country, who
had got an estate by ruining honest people in town.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> There's rogues for ye!</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> I'm mistaken if they don't play you some trick
or other.</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Hold, let me consider.</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> What are you doing?</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> I'm <em>conceiving</em>, I shall <em>bring forth</em> presently&mdash;&mdash;oh,
I have it, it comes from hence, wit was its father,
and invention its mother; if I had thought on't sooner,
I shou'd have been happy.</p>

<p><em>Griff.</em> What is it?</p>

<p>Mr. <em>Barn.</em> Come, come along, I say; you must help
me to put it in execution.</p>

for he's a sort of desperate spark, and a body does not
know what he may do, if he shou'd not hear from you;

Come back, I have something to say to you.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> What's that to you what I want? perhaps I have
something to say to her that will make her laugh&mdash;&mdash;why
sure! what need you care?</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Don't snub my cousin <em>Charly</em>&mdash;&mdash;well, what is't?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Who do you think I met, as I was coming here,
but that handsome gentleman I've seen at church ogle
you like any devil?</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Hush, softly, cousin.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Not a word of that for your life.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> O I know I shou'd not speak on't before folks;
you know I made signs to you above, that I wanted to
speak to you in private, didn't I, cousin?</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Yes, yes, I saw you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_170" id="Page_170">[Pg 170]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Char.</em> You see I can keep a secret.&mdash;&mdash;I am no girl,
mun&mdash;&mdash;I believe I cou'd tell you fifty and fifty to
that, of my sister <em>Cicely</em>&mdash;&mdash;O she's the devil of a
girl&mdash;&mdash;but she gives me money and sugar-plumbs&mdash;&mdash;and
those that are kind to me fare the better for it, you
see cousin.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> I always said my cousin <em>Charly</em> was a good-natur'd
boy.</p>

<p><em>Lis.</em> Well, and did he know you?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Yes, I think he did know me&mdash;for he took me
in his arms, and did so hug and kiss me&mdash;&mdash;between
you and I, cousin, I believe he is one of the best friends
I have in the world.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Well, but what did he say to you?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Why, he ask'd me where I was going; I told
him I was coming to see you; you're a lying young rogue,
says he, I'm sure you dare not go see your cousin&mdash;for
you must know my sister was with me, and it seems he took
her for a crack, and I being a forward boy, he fancied I
was going to make love to her under a hedge, ha, ha.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> So.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> So he offer'd to lay me a <em>Lewis d'Or</em> that I was
not coming to you; so done, says I&mdash;&mdash;Done, says
he,&mdash;&mdash;and so 'twas a bett, you know.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Certainly.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> So my sister's honour being concern'd, and
having a mind to win his <em>Lewis d'Or</em>, d'ye see&mdash;&mdash;I bid
him follow me, that he might see whether I came in or
no&mdash;but he said he'd wait for me at the little garden gate
that opens into the fields, and if I would come thro' the
house and meet him there, he should know by that whether
I had been in or no.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Very well.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> So I went there, open'd the gate and let him in&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> What then?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Why then he paid me the <em>Lewis d'Or</em>, that's all.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> Why, that was honestly done.</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> And then he talk'd to me of you, and said you
had the charmingest bubbies, and every time he nam'd
'em, ha! says he, as if he had been sipping hot tea.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_171" id="Page_171">[Pg 171]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> But was this all?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> No, for he had a mind, you must know, to win
his <em>Lewis d'Or</em> back again; so he laid me another, that
I dare not come back, and tell you that he was there;
so cousin, I hope you won't let me lose, for if you don't
go to him and tell him that I've won, he won't pay me.</p>

<p><em>Mar.</em> What, wou'd you have me go and speak to a
man?</p>

<p><em>Char.</em> Not for any harm, but to win your poor cousin
a <em>Lewis d'Or</em>. I'm sure you will&mdash;for you're a modest
young woman, and may go without danger&mdash;&mdash;Well,
cousin, I'll swear you look very handsome to-day, and
have the prettiest bubbies there; do let me feel 'em, I'll
swear you must.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">What</span> prudent cares does this deep foreseeing
nation take, for the support of its worshipful
families! In order to which, and that they may not fail
to be always significant and useful in their country, it
is a settled foundation-point that every child that is
born shall be a beggar&mdash;&mdash;except one; and that
he&mdash;&mdash;shall be a fool&mdash;&mdash;My grandfather was bred
a fool, as the country report: my father was a fool,&mdash;&mdash;as
my mother used to say; my brother was a
fool, to my own knowledge, though a great justice
of the peace; and he has left a son, that will make
his son a fool, or I am mistaken. The lad is now
fourteen years old, and but just out of his Psalter.
As to his honour'd father, my much esteem'd nephew,
here I have him. [<em>Shewing a letter.</em>] In this pro<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_180" id="Page_180">[Pg 180]</a></span>profound
epistle (which I have just now received)
there is the top and bottom of him. Forty years and
two is the age of him; in which it is computed by
his butler, his own person has drank two and thirty
ton of ale. The rest of his time has been employed
in persecuting all the poor four-legg'd creatures round,
that wou'd but run away fast enough from him, to
give him the high-mettled pleasure of running after
them. In this noble employ he has broke his right arm,
his left leg, and both his collar-bones&mdash;&mdash;Once he
broke his neck, but that did him no harm: A nimble
hedge leaper, a brother of the stirrup that was by,
whipt off his horse and mended it. His estate being
left him with two jointures, and three weighty mortgages
upon it, he to make all easy, and pay his brother's
and sister's portions, married a profuse young
housewife for love, with never a penny of money.
Having done all this, like his brave ancestors, for
the support of the family, he now finds children and
interest money make such a bawling about his ears,
that he has taken the friendly advice of his neighbour,
the good Lord <em>Courtlove</em>, to run his estate two thousand
pounds more in debt, that he may retrieve his affairs
by being a parliament-man, and bringing his wife to
<em>London</em>, to play off an hundred pounds at dice with ladies
of quality, before breakfast.</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><em><span class="smcap">I</span> do not doubt but you have much rejoiced at my success,
in my election; it has cost me some money, I own: but
what of all that! I am a parliament-man, and that will
set all to rights. I have lived in the country all my days,
'tis true; but what then! I have made speeches at the
sessions, and in the vestry too, and can elsewhere perhaps,
as well as some others that do; and I have a noble friend
hard by, who has let me into some small knowledge of what's
what at <span class="antiqua">Westminster</span>. And so that I may always be at
hand to serve my country, I have consulted with my wife,
about taking a house at <span class="antiqua">London</span>, and bringing her and my

</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Sir, Sir, do you hear the news? they are all
a-coming.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Ay, sirrah, I hear it with a pox to it.</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Sir, here's <em>John Moody</em> arriv'd already; he's
stumping about the streets in his dirty boots, and asking
every man he meets, if they can tell where he may
have a good lodging for a parliament-man, 'till he can
hire such a house as becomes him; he tells them his lady
and all the family are coming too, and that they are
so nobly attended, they care not a fig for any body.
Sir, they have added two cart-horses to the four old
geldings, because my lady will have it said, she came to
town in her coach and six, and (ha, ha,) heavy <em>George</em>
the plowman rides postillion.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Very well; the journey begins as it shou'd
do&mdash;&mdash;<em>James</em>.</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Sir.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Dost know whether they bring all the
children with them?</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Only 'Squire <em>Humphry</em>, and Miss <em>Betty</em>, Sir;
the other six are put to board at half a crown a week a
head, with <em>Joan Growse</em>, at <em>Smoke-Dunghill</em> farm.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> The Lord have mercy upon all good
folks! what work will these people make! dost know
when they'll be here?</p>

<p><em>James.</em> <em>John</em> says, Sir, they'd have been here last
night, but that the old wheezy-belly horse tir'd, and
the two fore-wheels came crash down at once in <em>Waggonrut</em>-lane.
Sir, they were cruelly loaden, as I understand;
my lady herself, he says, laid on four mail
trunks, besides the great deal-box, which fat <em>Tom</em> sat
upon behind.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_182" id="Page_182">[Pg 182]</a></span></p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Soh!</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Then within the coach there was Sir <em>Francis</em>,
my Lady, and the great fat lap-dog, 'Squire <em>Humphry</em>,
Miss <em>Betty</em>, my Lady's maid Mrs. Handy, and <em>Doll Tripe</em>
the cook; but she puked with sitting backward, so they
mounted her into the coach-box.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Very well.</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Then, Sir, for fear of a famine, before they
should get to the baiting-place, there was such baskets
of plumb-cake, Dutch-gingerbread, Cheshire-cheese,
Naples-biscuits, Macaroons, Neats-tongues, and cold
boil'd beef&mdash;&mdash;and in case of sickness, such bottles of
usquebaugh, black cherry-brandy, cinamon-water, sack,
tent, and strong beer, as made the old coach crack
again.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Well said!</p>

<p><em>James.</em> And for defence of this good cheer, and my
Lady's little pearl necklace, there was the family basket-hilt
sword, the great Turkish cimiter, the old blunderbuss,
a good bag of bullets, and a great horn of
gunpowder.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Admirable!</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Then for band-boxes, they were so bepiled
up to Sir <em>Francis</em>'s nose, that he could only peep out at
a chance hole with one eye, as if he were viewing the
country thro' a perspective glass. But, Sir, if you
please, I'll go look after <em>John Moody</em> a little for fear of
accidents: For he never was in <em>London</em> before, you
know, but one week, and then he was kidnapp'd into
a house of ill repute, where he exchang'd all his money
and clothes for a&mdash;&mdash;um. So I'll go look after him,
Sir.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Nay, I don't doubt but this wise expedition
will be attended with more adventures than one.&mdash;&mdash;This
noble head, and supporter of his family,
will, as an honest country gentleman, get credit
enough amongst the tradesmen, to run so far in debt in
one session, as will make him just fit for a gaol, when
he's drop'd at the next election. He will make his
speeches in the house to shew the government of what im<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_183" id="Page_183">[Pg 183]</a></span>portance
he can be to them, by which they will see, he
can be of no importance at all; and he will find in time,
that he stands valued at (if he votes right) being sometimes&mdash;&mdash;invited
to dinner. Then his wife (who
has ten times more of a jade about her than he yet
knows of) will so improve in this rich soil, she will, in
one month, learn every vice the finest lady in the town
can teach her. She will be extremely courteous to the
fops who make love to her in jest, and she will be extremely
grateful to those who do it in earnest. She will
visit all ladies that will let her into their houses, and
she will run in debt to all the shopkeepers that will let
her into their books. In short, before her husband has
got five pound by a speech at <em>Westminster</em>, she will have
lost five hundred at cards and dice in the parish of <em>St.
James</em>'s. Wife and family to <em>London</em> with a pox!</p>

for you might have a law-suit with him when you pleas'd,

<p class="directcenter"><em>Lord</em> Loverule's <em>House</em>.

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Lord <span class="antiqua">Loverule</span>, and Lady <span class="antiqua">Arabella</span>. He
following her.</em>
</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> <span class="smcap"><span class="fauxcap">W</span>ell</span>, look you, my Lord, I can bear
it no longer; nothing still but about
my faults, my faults! an agreeable subject truly!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> But, Madam, if you won't hear of your
faults, how is it likely you shou'd ever mend 'em?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Why I don't intend to mend 'em. I can't
mend 'em, I have told you so an hundred times; you
know I have try'd to do it, over and over, and it hurts
me so, I can't bear it. Why, don't you know, my Lord,
that whenever (just to please you only) I have gone about
to wean myself from a fault (one of my faults I mean that
I love dearly) han't it put me so out of humour, you
cou'd scarce endure the house with me?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Look you, my dear, it is very true, that
in weaning one's self from&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Weaning! why ay, don't you see, that even
in weaning poor children from the nurse, it's almost the
death of 'em? and don't you see your true religious people
when they go about to wean themselves, and have solemn
days of fasting and praying, on purpose to help
them, does it not so disorder them, there's no coming
near 'em? are they not as cross as the devil? and then
they don't do the business neither; for next day their
faults are just where they were the day before.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> But, Madam, can you think it a reasonable
thing to be abroad till two o'clock in the morning, when
you know I go to bed at eleven?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_195" id="Page_195">[Pg 195]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> And can you think it a wise thing (to talk
your own way now) to go to bed at eleven, when you
know I am likely to disturb you by coming there at
three?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Well, the manner of womens living of
late is insupportable, and some way or other&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> It's to be mended, I suppose&mdash;Pray, my
Lord, one word of fair argument: You complain of my
late hours; I of your early ones; so far we are even,
you'll allow; but which gives us the best figure in the
eye of the polite world? my two o'clock speaks life,
activity, spirit, and vigour; your eleven has a dull,
drowsy, stupid, good-for-nothing sound with it. It favours
much of a mechanic, who must get to bed betimes,
that he may rise early to open his shop. Faugh!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> I thought to go to bed early and rise so,
was ever esteem'd a right practice for all people.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Beasts do it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Fy, fy, Madam, fy; but 'tis not your ill
hours alone disturb me; but the ill company who occasion
those ill hours.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> And pray what ill company may those be?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Why, women that lose their money, and
men that win it: especially when 'tis to be paid out of
their husband's estate; or if that fail, and the creditor
be a little pressing, the lady will, perhaps, be oblig'd to
try if the gentleman instead of gold will accept of a
trinket.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> My Lord, you grow scurrilous, and you'll
make me hate you. I'll have you to know, I keep company
with the politest people in the town, and the assemblies
I frequent are full of such.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> So are the churches now and then.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> My friends frequent them often, as well as
the assemblies.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> They wou'd do it oftener if a groom of the
chamber there were allow'd to furnish cards and dice to
the company.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> You'd make a woman mad.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> You'd make a man a fool.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_196" id="Page_196">[Pg 196]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> If Heav'n has made you otherwise, that
won't be in my power.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> I'll try if I can prevent your making me a
beggar at least.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> A beggar! Crœsus! I'm out of patience&mdash;I
won't come home 'till four to-morrow morning.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> I'll order the doors to be lock'd at twelve.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Then I won't come home till to-morrow
night.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Then you shall never come home again,
Madam.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> There he has knock'd me down: my father
upon our marriage said, wives were come to that
pass, he did not think it fit they shou'd be trusted with
pin money, and so would not let this man settle one
penny upon his poor wife, to serve her at a dead lift for
separate maintenance.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter <span class="antiqua">Clarinda</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Good-morrow, Madam; how do you do to-day?
you seem to be in a little fluster.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> My Lord has been in one, and as I am the
most complaisant poor creature in the world, I put myself
into one too, purely to be suitable company to him.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> You are prodigious good; but surely it must be
mighty agreeable when a man and his wife can give
themselves the same turn of conversation.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> O, the prettiest thing in the world.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> But yet, tho' I believe there's no life so happy
as a marry'd one, in the main; yet I fancy, where two
people are so very much together, they must often be in
want of something to talk upon.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> <em>Clarinda</em>, you are the most mistaken in the
world; married people have things to talk of, child, that
never enter into the imagination of others. Why now,
here's my Lord and I, we han't been married above two
short years you know, and we have already eight or ten
things constantly in bank, that whenever we want company
we can talk of any of them for two hours together,
and the subject never the flatter. It will be as fresh next
day, if we have occasion for it, as it was the first day it
entertained us.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_197" id="Page_197">[Pg 197]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why that must be wonderful pretty.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> O there's no life like it. This very day
now for example, my Lord and I, after a pretty cheerful
<em>tête à tête</em> dinner, sat down by the fire-side, in an idle,
indolent, pick-tooth way for a while, as if we had not
thought of one another's being in the room. At last,
stretching himself, and yawning twice, my dear, says he,
you came home very late last night. 'Twas but two
in the morning, says I. I was in bed (<em>yawning</em>) by eleven,
says he. So you are every night, says I. Well, says he,
I'm amazed how you can sit up so late. How can you
be amazed, says I, at a thing that happens so often?
Upon which we enter'd into conversation. And tho'
this is a point has entertain'd us above fifty times already,
we always find so many pretty new things to say upon't,
that I believe in my soul it will last as long as we live.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> But in such sort of family dialogues, tho' extremely
well for passing of time, don't there now and
then enter some little sort of bitterness?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> O yes; which don't do amiss at all; a little
something that's sharp, moderates the extreme sweetness
of matrimonial society, which would else perhaps be
cloying. Tho' to tell you the truth, <em>Clarinda</em>, I think
we squeezed a little too much lemon into it this bout;
for it grew so sour at last, that I think I almost told him
he was a fool; and he talkt something oddly of turning
me out of doors.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> O, but have a care of that.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Why, to be serious, <em>Clarinda</em>, what wou'd
you have a woman do in my case? There is no one
thing he can do in the world to please me&mdash;&mdash;Except
giving me money; and that he is grown weary of; and
I at the same time, partly by nature, and partly perhaps
by keeping the best company, do with my soul love
almost every thing that he hates; I dote upon assemblies,
adore masquerades, my heart bounds at a ball; I
love a play to distraction, cards inchant me, and dice&mdash;put
me out of my little wits&mdash;Dear, dear hazard,
what music there is in the rattle of the dice, com<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_198" id="Page_198">[Pg 198]</a></span>pared
to a sleepy opera! Do you ever play at hazard,
<em>Clarinda</em>?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Never; I don't think it fits well upon women;
it's very masculine, and has too much of a rake; you see
how it makes the men swear and curse. Sure it must
incline the women to do the same too if they durst give
way to it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> So it does; but hitherto for a little decency,
we keep it in; and when in spite of our teeth, an
oath gets into our mouths, we swallow it.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> That's enough to burst you; but in time perhaps
you'll let 'em fly as they do.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Why, 'tis probable we may, for the pleasure
of all polite womens lives now, you know, is
founded upon entire liberty to do what they will. But
shall I tell you what happened t'other night? having
lost all my money but ten melancholy guineas, and
throwing out for them, what do you think slipt from me?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> An oath?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Gud soons!</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> O Lord! O Lord! did not it frighten you out
of your wits?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> <em>Clarinda</em>, I thought a gun had gone off.&mdash;But
I forget you are a prude, and design to live soberly.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why 'tis true; both my nature and education,
do in a good degree incline me that way.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Well, surely to be sober is to be terribly
dull. You will marry; won't you?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> I can't tell but I may.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> And you'll live in town?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Half the year, I should like it very well.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> And you wou'd live in <em>London</em> half a year,
to be sober in it?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Yes.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Why can't you as well go and be sober in
the country?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> So I wou'd the other half year.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> And pray what pretty scheme of life wou'd
you form now, for your summer and winter sober entertainments?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_199" id="Page_199">[Pg 199]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> A scheme that I think might very well content
us.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Let's hear it.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> I cou'd in summer pass my time very agreeably,
in riding soberly, in walking soberly, in sitting under a
tree soberly, in gardening soberly, in reading soberly,
in hearing a little music soberly, in conversing with some
agreeable friends soberly, in working soberly, in managing
my family and children (if I had any) soberly, and
possibly by these means I might induce my husband to be
as sober as myself.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Well, <em>Clarinda</em>, thou art a most contemptible
creature. But let's have the sober town scheme
too, for I am charm'd with the country one.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> You shall, and I'll try to stick to my sobriety
there too.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> If you do, you'll make me sick of you. But
let's hear it however.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> I wou'd entertain myself in observing the new
fashion soberly, I wou'd please myself in new clothes
soberly, I wou'd divert myself with agreeable friends at
home and abroad soberly. I wou'd play at quadrille
soberly, I wou'd go to court soberly, I wou'd go to some
plays soberly, I wou'd go to operas soberly, and I think
I cou'd go once, or, if I lik'd my company, twice to a
masquerade, soberly.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> If it had not been for that last piece of sobriety,
I was going to call for some surfeit-water.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Why, don't you think, that with the further aid
of breakfasting, dining, supping and sleeping (not to
say a word of devotion) the four and twenty hours might
roll over in a tolerable manner?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> How I detest that word, Tolerable! And
so will a country relation of ours that's newly come to
town, or I'm mistaken.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Who is that?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Even my dear Lady <em>Headpiece</em>.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Is she come?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Yes, her sort of a tolerable husband has
gotten to be chosen parliament-man at some simple town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_200" id="Page_200">[Pg 200]</a></span>
or other, upon which she has persuaded him to bring
her and her folks up to <em>London</em>.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> That's good; I think she was never here before.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Not since she was nine years old; but she
has had an outrageous mind to it ever since she was
marry'd.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Then she'll make the most of it, I suppose, now
she is come.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Depend upon that.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> We must go and visit her.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> By all means; and may be you'll have a
mind to offer her your tolerable scheme for her <em>London</em>
diversion this winter; if you do, mistress, I'll shew her
mine too, and you'll see she'll so despise you and adore
me, that if I do but chirrup to her, she'll hop after me
like a tame sparrow, the town round. But there's your
admirer I see coming in, I'll oblige him and leave you
to receive part of his visit, while I step up to write a
letter. Besides, to tell you the truth, I don't like him
half so well as I used to do; he falls off of late from
being the company he was, in our way. In short, I think
he's growing to be a little like my lord.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Sir <span class="antiqua">Charles</span>.</em>
</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Madam, your servant; they told me Lady
<em>Arabella</em> was here.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> She's only stept up to write a letter, she'll come
down presently.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Why, does she write letters? I thought
she had never time for't: pray how may she have dispos'd
of the rest of the day?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> A good deal as usual; she has visits to make
'till six; she's then engag'd to the play, from that 'till
court-time, she's to be at cards at Mrs. <em>Idle</em>'s; after the
drawing-room, she takes a short supper with Lady
<em>Hazard</em>, and from thence they go together to the assembly.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. And are you to do all this with her?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> The visits and the play, no more.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. And how can you forbear all the rest?</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> 'Tis easy to forbear, what we are not very fond
of.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_201" id="Page_201">[Pg 201]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. I han't found it so. I have past much of
my life in this hurry of the ladies, yet was never so
pleas'd as when I was at quiet without 'em.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> What then induc'd you to be with 'em?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Idleness and the fashion.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> No mistresses in the case?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. To speak honestly, yes. When one is in
a toyshop, there was no forbearing the baubles; so I
was perpetually engaging with some coquet or other,
whom I cou'd love perhaps just enough to put it into her
power to plague me.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> Which power I suppose she sometimes made use
of.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. The amours of a coquet, Madam, general'y
mean nothing farther; I look upon them and
prudes to be nuisances much alike, tho' they seem very
different; the first are always disturbing the men, and
the latter always abusing the women.</p>

<p><em>Clar.</em> And all I think is to establish the character of
being virtuous.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. That is, being chaste they mean, for they
know no other virtue; therefore indulge themselves in
every thing else that's vicious; they (against nature)
keep their chastity, only because they find more pleasure
in doing mischief with it, than they shou'd have in parting
with it. But, Madam, if both these characters are
so odious, how highly to be valued is that woman, who
can attain all they aim at, without the aid of the folly
or vice of either!</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Lady <span class="antiqua">Arabella</span>.</em>
</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Your servant, Sir. I won't ask your pardon
for leaving you alone a little with a lady that I know
shares so much of your good opinion.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. I wish, Madam, she cou'd think my good
opinion of value enough, to afford me a small part in
hers.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> I believe, Sir, every woman who knows
she has a place in a fine gentleman's good opinion, will
be glad to give him one in hers, if she can. But however<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_202" id="Page_202">[Pg 202]</a></span>
you two may stand in one another's, you must take
another time, if you desire to talk farther about it, or we
shan't have enough to make our visits in; and so your
servant, Sir. Come, <em>Clarinda</em>.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. I'll stay and make my Lord a visit, if you
will give me leave.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> You have my leave, Sir, tho' you were a
Lady.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit with <span class="antiqua">Clar</span>.</em></p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Lord <span class="antiqua">Loverule</span>.</em>
</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Sir <em>Charles</em>, your servant; what, have the
ladies left you?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Yes, and the ladies in general I hope
will leave me too.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Why so?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. That I mayn't be put to the ill manners
of leaving them first.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Do you then already find your gallantry
inclining to an ebb?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. 'Tis not that I am yet old enough to justify
myself in an idle retreat, but I have got I think a
sort of surfeit on me, that lessens much the force of female
charms.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Have you then been so glutted with their
favours?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Not with their favours, but with their
service; it is unmerciful. I once thought myself a tolerable
time-killer; I drank, I play'd, I intrigu'd, and
yet I had hours enough for reasonable uses; but he that
will list himself a lady's man of mettle now, she'll work
him so at cards and dice, she won't afford him time
enough to play with her at any thing else, though she herself
should have a tolerable good mind to it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> And so the disorderly lives they lead,
incline you to a reform of your own.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. 'Tis true; for bad examples (if they are
but bad enough) give us as useful reflections as good
ones do.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> 'Tis pity any thing that's bad, shou'd
come from women.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_203" id="Page_203">[Pg 203]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. 'Tis so, indeed, and there was a happy
time, when both you and I thought there never could.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Our early first conceptions of them, I
well remember, were that they never could be vicious, nor
never could be old.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. We thought so then; the beauteous form
we saw them cast in, seem'd design'd a habitation for
no vice, nor no decay; all I had conceiv'd of angels, I
conceiv'd of them; true, tender, gentle, modest, generous,
constant, I thought was writ in every feature; and
in my devotions, Heaven, how did I adore thee, that
blessings like them should be the portion of such poor inferior
creatures as I took myself and all men else (compared
with them) to be!&mdash;but where's that adoration now?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> 'Tis with such fond young fools as you
and I were then.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. And with such it will ever be.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Ever. The pleasure is so great, in believing
women to be what we wish them, that nothing
but a long and sharp experience can ever make us think
them otherwise. That experience, friend, both you and
I have had, but yours has been at other mens expence;
mine&mdash;&mdash;at my own.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Perhaps you'd wonder, shou'd you find me
dispos'd to run the risque of that experience too.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> I shou'd, indeed.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. And yet 'tis possible I may; I know at
least, I still have so much of my early folly left, to think,
there's yet one woman fit to make a wife of: How far
such a one can answer the charms of a mistress, marry'd
men are silent in, so pass&mdash;&mdash;for that I'd take my chance;
but cou'd she make a home easy to her partner, by letting
him find there a chearful companion, an agreeable intimate,
a useful assistant, a faithful friend, and (in its
time perhaps) a tender mother, such change of life,
from what I lead, seems not unwise to think of.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Nor unwise to purchase, if to be had for
millions, but&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. But what?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_204" id="Page_204">[Pg 204]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> If the reverse of this shou'd chance to be
the bitter disappointment, what wou'd the life be then?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. A damn'd one.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> And what relief?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. A short one; leave it, and return to that
you left, if you can't find a better.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> He says right&mdash;that's the remedy, and a
just one&mdash;&mdash;for if I sell my liberty for gold, and I am
foully paid in brass, shall I be held to keep the bargain?</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em>.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. What are you thinking of?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> Of what you have said.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. And was it well said?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> I begin to think it might.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Charles</em>. Think on, 'twill give you ease&mdash;&mdash;the
man who has courage enough to part with a wife need
not much dread the having one; and he that has not,
ought to tremble at being a husband&mdash;&mdash;But perhaps I
have said too much; you'll pardon however the freedom
of an old friend, because you know I am so; so your
servant.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> <em>Charles</em>, farewell, I can take nothing as ill-meant
that comes from you. Nor ought my wife to
think I mean amiss to her; if I convince her I'll endure
no longer that she would thus expose herself and me.
No doubt 'twill grieve her sorely. Physick's a loathsome
thing, 'till we find it gives us health, and then we are
thankful to those who made us take it. Perhaps she may
do so by me, if she does, 'tis well; if not, and she resolves
to make the house ring with reprisals: I believe
(tho' the misfortune's great) he'll make a better figure
in the world, who keeps an ill wife out of doors, than he
that keeps her within.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> <span class="smcap"><span class="fauxcap">S</span>o</span>, you are acquainted with Lady <em>Arabella</em>,
I find.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Oh, Madam, I have had the honour to
know her Ladyship almost from a child, and a charming
woman she has made.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> I like her prodigiously; I had some acquaintance
with her in the country two years ago; but
she's quite another woman here.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Ah, Madam, two years keeping company
with the polite people of the town will do wonders
in the improvement of a lady, so she has it but about
her.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Now 'tis my misfortune, Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>,
to come late to school.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Oh! don't be discourag'd at that, Madam,
the quickness of your ladyship's parts will easily
recover your loss of a little time.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> O! You flatter me! But I'll endeavour
by industry and application to make it up; such parts as
I have shall not lie idle. My Lady <em>Arabella</em> has been
so good to offer me already her introduction, to those assemblies,
where a woman may soonest learn to make
herself valuable to every body.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> But her husband. [<em>Aside.</em>] Her Ladyship,
Madam, can indeed, better than any body, introduce
you, where every thing that accomplishes a fine lady,
is practised to the last perfection; Madam, she herself is
at the very tip-top of it&mdash;&mdash;'tis pity, poor lady, she
shou'd meet with any discouragements.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> But one should not talk of people of qualities
family-concerns.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> O, no matter, Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>, as long as
it goes no farther. My Lord, you were saying&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Why, my Lord, Madam, is a little humoursome,
they say.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Humoursome?</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Yes, they say he's humoursome.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> As how, pray?</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Why, if my poor lady perhaps does but
stay out at night, may be four or five hours after he's
in bed, he'll be cross.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> What, for such a thing as that?</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Yes, he'll be cross; and then if she happens,
it may be, to be unfortunate at play, and lose a
great deal of money, more than she has to pay, then
Madam&mdash;&mdash;he'll snub.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Out upon him! snub such a woman as
she is? I can tell you, Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>, I that am but a
country lady, should Sir <em>Francis</em> take upon him to snub
me, in <em>London</em>, he'd raise a spirit would make his hair
stand on end.</p>

deal with 'em.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> No by my troth won't I. What are you
talking of my being married, mother?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> No, Miss; Mrs. <em>Motherly</em> was only saying
what a good wife you wou'd make, when you were
so.</p>

then the next night after, we&mdash;&mdash;</p>

to-night, colonel?</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> I did not design it, Madam; but now I find there
is to be such good company, I'll do myself the honour
(if you'll give me leave, ladies) to come and lead you to
your coach.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> It's extremely obliging.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty</em>. It is indeed mighty well-bred. Lord!
colonel, what a difference there is between your way
and our country companions; one of them would have
said, what, you are aw gooing to the playhouse then?
Yes, says we, won't you come and lead us out? No, by
good feggins, says he, ye ma' e'en ta' care o' yoursells,
y'are awd enough; and so he'd ha' gone to get drunk at
the tavern against we came home to supper.</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> Ha, ha, ha! well, sure Madam, your
Ladyship is the happiest mother in the world to have
such a charming companion to your daughter.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> The prettiest creature upon earth!</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> D'ye hear that, mother? Well, he's a
fine gentleman really, and I think a man of admirable
sense.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Softly, Miss, he'll hear you.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> If he does, Madam, he'll think I say true,
and he'll like me never the worse for that, I hope.
Where's your niece <em>Martilla</em>, Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>? Mama,
won't you carry <em>Martilla</em> to the play with us?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> With all my heart, child.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> She's a very pretty civil sort of woman, Madam,
and miss will be very happy in having such a companion
in the house with her.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> So I shall indeed, Sir, and I love her
dearly already, we are growing very great together.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> But what's become of your brother, child?
I han't seen him these two hours, where is he?</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Indeed, mother, I don't know where he
is; I saw him asleep about half an hour ago by the
kitchen fire.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> Must not he go to the play too?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head</em>. Yes, I think he shou'd go, tho' he'll be
weary on't, before it's half done.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Weary? yes; and then he'll sit, and
yawn, and stretch like a grayhound by the fire-side,
'till he does some nasty thing or other, that they'll turn
him out of the house, so it's better to leave him at
home.</p>

<p>Squire <em>Humph.</em> And so 'twill be nine o'clock, before
one shall get any supper.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Supper! why your dinner is not out of
your mouth yet, at least 'tis all about the brims of it.
See how greasy his chops is, mother.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Nay, if he han't a mind to go, he need
not. You may stay here 'till your father comes home
from the parliament-house, and then you may eat a
broil'd bone together.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Yes, and drink a tankard of strong beer
together; and then he may tell you all he has been doing
in the parliament-house, and you may tell him all
you have been thinking of when you were asleep, in
the kitchen: and then if you'll put it all down in writ<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_209" id="Page_209">[Pg 209]</a></span>ing,
when we come from the play, I'll read it to the
company.</p>

<p>Squire <em>Humph.</em> Sister, I don't like your joaking, and
you are not a well-behav'd young woman; and altho'
my mother encourages you, my thoughts are, you are
not too big to be whipt.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> How, sirrah?</p>

<p>Squire <em>Humph.</em> There's a civil young gentlewoman
stands there, is worth a hundred of you. And I believe
she'll be married before you.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Cots my life, I have a good mind to pull
your eyes out.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Hold, Miss, hold, don't be in such a passion,
neither.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Mama, it is not that I am angry at any
thing he says to commend <em>Martilla</em>, for I wish she were
to be marry'd to-morrow, that I might have a dance at
her wedding; but what need he abuse me for? I wish
the lout had mettle enough to be in love with her, she'd
make pure sport with him. [<em>Aside.</em>] Does your Heaviness
find any inclinations moving towards the lady you admire&mdash;&mdash;Speak!
are you in love with her?</p>

<p>Squire <em>Humph.</em> I am in love with nobody; and if any

quiet.</p>

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Hold your tongue, I'm quite sick of you.
Come, <em>Martilla</em>, you are to go to the play with us.</p>

<p><em>Mart.</em> Am I, Miss? I am ready to wait upon you.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> I believe it's time we should be going;
Colonel, is not it?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Well, daughter, since you are so courageous,
it shan't be said I make any difficulty; and if the

we have room for him, if he pleases.</p>

uncle <em>Richard</em>.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Uncle <span class="antiqua">Richard</span>.</em>
</p>

<p>Mrs. <em>Moth.</em> I think, Sir, I had better get you a mouthful
of something to stay your stomach 'till supper.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> With all my heart, for I'm almost famish'd.</p>

<p>Squire <em>Humph.</em> And so shall I before my mother
comes from the playhouse, so I'll go and get a butter'd
toast.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Uncle, I hope you are well.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Nephew, if I had been sick I wou'd not
have come abroad; I suppose you are well, for I sent
this morning, and was inform'd you went out early;
was it to make your court to some of the great men?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Yes, uncle, I was advised to lose no time,
so I went to one great man, whom I had never seen
before.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> And who had you got to introduce you?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Nobody; I remember'd I had heard a
wise man say, My son, be bold; so I introduced myself.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> As how, I pray?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_212" id="Page_212">[Pg 212]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why thus, uncle; please your Lordship,
says I, I am Sir <em>Francis Headpiece</em> of <em>Headpiece-Hall</em>, and
member of parliament for the ancient borough of <em>Gobble-Guiney</em>.
Sir, your humble servant, says my Lord,
tho' I have not the honour to know your person, I have
heard you are a very honest gentleman, and I am very
glad your borough has made choice of so worthy a representative;
have you any service to command me?
Those last words, uncle, gave me great encouragement:
And tho' I know you have not any very great opinion of
my parts, I believe you won't say I mist it now.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> I hope I shall have no cause.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> My Lord, says I, I did not design to say any
thing to your Lordship to-day about business; but since
your Lordship is so kind and free, as to bid me speak if
I have any service to command you, I will.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> So.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> I have, says I, my Lord, a good estate, but
it's a little out at elbows: and as I desire to serve my
king as well as my country, I shall be very willing to
accept of a place at court.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> This was bold indeed.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> I'cod, I shot him flying, uncle; another
man would have been a month before he durst have
open'd his mouth about a place. But you shall hear.
Sir <em>Francis</em>, says my Lord, what sort of a place may
you have turn'd your thoughts upon? My Lord, says I,
beggars must not be choosers; but some place about a
thousand a year, I believe, might do pretty weel to
begin with. Sir <em>Francis</em>, says he, I shall be glad to
serve you in any thing I can; and in saying these
words he gave me a squeeze by the hand, as much as to
say, I'll do your business. And so he turn'd to a
Lord that was there, who look'd as if he came for a
place too.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> And so your fortune's made.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Don't you think so, uncle?</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Yes, for just so mine was made&mdash;&mdash;twenty
years ago.<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_213" id="Page_213">[Pg 213]</a></span>
Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, I never knew you had a place,
uncle.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Nor I neither upon my faith, nephew:
but you have been down at the house since you made
your court, have not you?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> O yes; I would not neglect the house for
ever so much.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> And what might they have done there to-day,
I pray?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why truly, uncle, I cannot well tell what
they did. But I'll tell you what I did: I happen'd to
make a little sort of a mistake.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> How was that?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why you must know, uncle, they were all
got into a sort of a hodge-podge argument for the good
of the nation, which I did not well understand; however
I was convinced, and so resolved to vote aright
according to my conscience; but they made such a
puzzling business on't, when they put the question, as
they call it, that, I believe, I cry'd Ay, when I should
have cry'd No; for a sort of a <em>Jacobite</em> that sat next me,
took me by the hand, and said, Sir, you are a man of
honour, and a true <em>Englishman</em>, and I shou'd be glad to
be better acquainted with you, and so he pull'd me
along with the croud into the lobby with him, when I
believe I should have staid where I was.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> And so, if you had not quite made your
fortune before, you have clench'd it now. Ah, thou
head of the <em>Headpieces</em>! [<em>Aside.</em>] How now, what's the

<p>Miss <em>Betty.</em> Would he had put out his neck, for making
us lose the play.</p>

<p>Squire <em>Humph.</em> Poor <em>Martilla</em> has scratch'd her little

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> And here's the poor Colonel; nobody
asks what he has done. I hope, Sir, you have got no
harm?</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> Only a little wounded with some pins I met with
about your Ladyship.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> I am sorry any thing about me should do
you harm.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> If it does, Madam, you have that about you, if
you please, will be my cure. I hope your Ladyship feels
nothing amiss?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Head.</em> Nothing at all, tho' we did roll about together
strangely.</p>

<p><em>Col.</em> We did, indeed. I'm sure we roll'd so, that
my poor hands were got once&mdash;&mdash;I don't know
where they were got. But her Ladyship I see will pass
by slips.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> It wou'd have been pity the colonel shou'd
have receiv'd any damage in his services to the Ladies;
he is the most complaisant man to e'm, uncle; always
ready when they have occasion for him.</p>

<p>Unc. <em>Rich.</em> Then I believe, nephew, they'll never let
him want business.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> O, but they shou'd not ride the free horse

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ha, ha, you're a wag, uncle; but I believe
he'd storm any thing.</p>

time I have been ordered to come with good-manners for
my money, to no purpose.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Your money, man! Is that the matter?
Why it has lain in the steward's hands this week for
you.</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> Madam, you yourself appointed me to come this
very morning for it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> But why did you come so late then?</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> So late! I came soon enough, I thought.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> That thinking wrong, makes us liable to
a world of disappointments: If you had thought of coming
one minute sooner, you had had your money.</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> Gad bless me, Madam, I had the money as
I thought, I'm sure it was telling out, and I was writing
a receipt for't.</p>

<p><em>Trus.</em> Why there you thought wrong again, Master.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Yes, for you shou'd never think of writing
a receipt till the money is in your pocket.</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> Why, I did think 'twas in my pocket.</p>

<p><em>Trus.</em> Look you, thinking again. Indeed, Mr. <em>Short-yard</em>,
you make so many blunders, 'tis impossible but
you must suffer by it, in your way of trade. I'm sorry
for you, and you'll be undone.</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> And well I may, when I sell my goods to people
that won't pay me for 'em, till the interest of my
money eats out all my profit: I sold them so cheap,
because I thought I shou'd be paid the next day.</p>

<p><em>Trus.</em> Why, there again! there's another of your
thoughts; paid the next day, and you han't been paid
this twelvemonth you see.</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> Oons, I han't been paid at all, Mistress.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Well, tradesmen are strange unreasonable
creatures, refuse to sell people any more things, and then
quarrel with 'em because they don't pay for those they
have had already. Now what can you say to that, Mr.
<em>Short-yard</em>?</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> Say! Why&mdash;'Sdeath, Madam, I don't know
what you talk of, I don't understand your argument.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Ara.</em> Why, what do you understand, man?</p>

<p><em>Short.</em> Why, I understand that I have had above a<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_219" id="Page_219">[Pg 219]</a></span>
hundred pounds due to me a year ago; that I came, by
appointment, just now to receive it: that it proved at
last to be but thirty instead of a hundred and ten; and
that while the steward was telling even that out, and I
was writing the receipt, comes Mrs. <em>Pop</em> here, and the
money was gone. But I'll be banter'd no longer if there's
law in <em>England</em>. Say no more, <em>Short-yard</em>.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Love.</em> I shall be glad to find this so; but he says
you have owed him above a hundred pounds this twelvemonth;
that he has been here forty times by appointment

QUEEN.</h3>


<p>
<em>May it please your Majesty</em>,<br />
</p>

<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">The</span> <em>English</em> <span class="smcap">Theatre</span> throws itself
with this Play, at Your MAJESTY's
Feet, for Favour and Support.</p>

<p>As their Public Diversions are a strong
Indication of the Genius of a People; the
following Scenes are an Attempt to Establish<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_228" id="Page_228">[Pg 228]</a></span>
such as are fit to entertain the Minds of a sensible
Nation; and to wipe off that Aspersion
of Barbarity, which the <em>Virtuosi</em> among our
Neighbours have sometimes thrown upon our
Taste.</p>

<p>The <em>Provok'd Husband</em>, is, at least, an Instance,
that any <em>English</em> Comedy may, to an
unusual number of Days, bring many Thousands
of His Majesty's good Subjects together,
to their Emolument and Delight, with
Innocence. And however little Share of that
Merit my unequal Pen may pretend to, yet
I hope the just Admirers of Sir <em>John Vanbrugh</em>
will allow I have, at worst, been a careful
Guardian of his Orphan Muse, by leading it
into Your Majesty's Royal Protection.</p>

<p>The Design of this Play being chiefly to
expose, and reform the licentious Irregularities
that, too often, break in upon the
Peace and Happiness of the Married State;
Where could so hazardous and unpopular an
undertaking be secure, but in the Protection
of a <span class="smcap">Princess</span>, whose exemplary Conjugal
Virtues have given such illustrious Proof of
what sublime Felicity that holy State is
capable?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_229" id="Page_229">[Pg 229]</a></span></p>

<p>And though a Crown is no certain Title
to Content; yet to the Honour of that Institution
be it said, the Royal Harmony of
Hearts that now inchants us from the Throne,
is a Reproach to the frequent Disquiet of
those many insensible Subjects about it, who
(from his Majesty's paternal Care of his
People) have more Leisure to be happy: And
'tis our <span class="smcap">Queen's</span> peculiar Glory, that we
often see Her as eminently rais'd above
her Circle, in private Happiness, as in
Dignity.</p>

<p>Yet Heaven, <span class="smcap">Madam</span>, that has placed
you on such Height, to be the more conspicuous
Pattern of your Sex, had still left
your Happiness imperfect, had it not given
those inestimable Treasures of your Mind,
and Person, to the only Prince on Earth
that could have deserved them: A Crown
received from Any, but the Happy Monarch's
Hand, who invested you with This,
which You now adorn, had only seemed the
Work of <em>Fortune</em>: But <em>Thus</em> bestow'd, the
World acknowledges it the due Reward of
<span class="smcap">Providence</span>, for One You once so gloriously
Refused.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_230" id="Page_230">[Pg 230]</a></span></p>

<p>But as the Fame of such elevated Virtue
has lifted the Plain Addresses of a whole
Nation into Eloquence, the best repeated
Eulogiums on that Theme are but Intrusions
on your Majesty's greater Pleasure of
secretly deserving them. I therefore beg leave,
to subscribe myself,</p>

<h3><a name="TO_THE5" id="TO_THE5">TO THE</a><br />

READER.</h3>


<p class="drop-capw"><span class="smcap">Having</span> taken upon me in the prologue to this
play, to give the auditors some short account of
that part of it which Sir <em>John Vanbrugh</em> left unfinished,
and not thinking it adviseable in that place, to limit
their judgment by so high a commendation as I thought
it deserved; I have therefore, for the satisfaction of the
curious, printed the whole of what he wrote, separately,
under the single title he gave it of <em>A Journey to London</em>,
without presuming to alter a line.</p>

<p>Yet when I own, that in my last conversation with
him, (which chiefly turned upon what he had done towards
a comedy) he excused his not shewing it me, 'till
he had reviewd it, confessing the scenes were yet undigested,
too long, and irregular, particularly in the
lower characters, I have but one excuse for publishing
what he never designed should come into the world, as
it then was, viz. I had no other way of taking those
many faults to myself, which may be justly found in my
presuming to finish it.</p>

<p>However, a judicious reader will find in his original
papers, that the characters are strongly drawn,
new, spirited, and natural, taken from sensible observations
on high and lower life, and from a just indignation
at the follies in fashion. All I could gather
from him of what he intended in the <em>catastrophe</em>, was,
that the conduct of his imaginary fine lady had so provoked
him, that he designed actually to have made her
husband turn her out of his doors. But when his per<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_232" id="Page_232">[Pg 232]</a></span>formance
came, after his decease, to my hands, I
thought such violent measures, however just they might be
in real life, were too severe for comedy, and would want
the proper surprise, which is due to the end of a play.
Therefore with much ado (and 'twas as much as I could
do with probability) I preserved the lady's chastity,
that the sense of her errors might make a reconciliation
not impracticable; and I hope the mitigation
of her sentence has been since justified by its
success.</p>

<p>My inclination to preserve as much as possible of Sir
<em>John</em>, I soon saw had drawn the whole into an unusual
length; the reader will therefore find here a scene or
two of the lower humour that were left out, after the first
day's presentation.</p>

<p>The favour the town has shewn to the higher characters
in this play, is a proof, that their taste is not
wholly vitiated, by the barbarous entertainments that
have been so expensively set off to corrupt it: but, while
the repetition of the best old plays is apt to give satiety,
and good new ones are so scarce a commodity, we must
not wonder, that the poor actors are sometimes forced to
trade in trash for a livelihood.</p>

<p>I cannot yet take leave of the reader, without endeavouring
to do justice to those principal actors, who
have so evidently contributed to the support of this
comedy: And I wish I could separate the praises due to
them from the secret vanity of an author: For all I
can say will still insinuate, that they could not have so
highly excelled, unless the skill of the writer had given
them proper occasion. However, as I had rather
appear vain, than unthankful, I will venture to say of
Mr. <em>Wilks</em>, that in the last act, I never saw any passion
take so natural a possession of an actor, or any actor
take so tender a possession of his auditors&mdash;&mdash;Mr.
<em>Mills</em> too, is confess'd by every body, to have surprised
them, by so far excelling himself&mdash;&mdash;But there is no
doing right to Mrs. <em>Oldfield</em>, without putting people<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_233" id="Page_233">[Pg 233]</a></span>
in mind of what others, of great merit, have wanted
to come near her&mdash;&mdash;'Tis not enough to say, she
<em>Here Out-did</em> her usual <em>Excellence</em>. I might therefore
justly leave her to the constant admiration of those spectators,
who have the pleasure of living while she is an
actress. But as this is not the only time she has been
the life of what I have given the public, so perhaps
my saying a little more of so memorable an actress,
may give this play a chance to be read, when the people
of this age shall be ancestors&mdash;&mdash;May it therefore
give emulation to our successors of the stage, to
know, That to the ending of the year 1727, a cotemporary
comedian relates, that Mrs. <em>Oldfield</em> was, then,
in her highest excellence of action, happy in all the
rearly-found requisites, that meet in one person to complete
them for the stage&mdash;&mdash;She was in stature just
rising to that height, where the <em>graceful</em> can only
begin to shew itself; of a lively aspect and a command
in her mein, that like the principal figure in the finest
paintings, first seizes, and longest delights the eye of
the spectators. Her voice was sweet, strong, piercing,
and melodious: her pronunciation voluble, distinct, and
musical; and her emphasis always placed where the
spirit of the sense, in her periods, only demanded it.
If she delighted more in the Higher Comic, than in
the Tragic strain, 'twas because the last is too often
written in a lofty disregard of nature. But in characters
of modern practised life, she found occasions
to add the particular air and manner which distinguished
the different humours she presented. Whereas
in tragedy, the manner of speaking varies, as little as the
blank verse it is written in&mdash;&mdash;She had one peculiar
happiness from nature, she looked and maintained the
<em>agreeable</em>, at a time when other fine women only raise
admirers by their understanding&mdash;&mdash;The spectator was
always as much informed by her eyes as her elocution;
for the look is the only proof that an actor rightly conceives
what he utters, there being scare an instance,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_234" id="Page_234">[Pg 234]</a></span>
where the eyes do their part, that the elocution is
known to be faulty. The qualities she had <em>acquired</em> were
the <em>genteel</em> and <em>elegant</em>. The one in her air, and the
other in her dress, never had her equal on the stage; and
the ornaments she herself provided, (particularly in this
play) seemed in all respects the <em>paraphernalia</em> of a woman
of quality. And of that sort were the characters she
chiefly excelled in; but her natural good sense and lively
turn of conversation made her way so easy to ladies of
the highest rank, that it is a less wonder, if on the stage
she sometimes <em>was</em>, what might have become the finest
woman in real life to have supported.</p>

ever any pleasure at home!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> It might be in your power, Madam, I
confess, to make it a little more comfortable to me.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Comfortable! and so, my good Lord,
you would really have a woman of my rank and spirit
stay at home to comfort her husband! Lord! what notions
of life some men have!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Don't you think, Madam, some ladies'
notions full as extravagant?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Yes, my Lord, when the tame doves
live cooped within the penn of your precepts, I do think
'em prodigious indeed!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> And when they fly wild about this town,
Madam, pray what must the world think of 'em then?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Oh! this world is not so ill-bred as to
quarrel with any woman for liking it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Nor am I, Madam, a husband so well-bred,
as to bear my wife's being so fond of it; in short,
the life you lead, Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Is, to me, the pleasantest life in the
world.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I should not dispute your taste, Madam,
if a woman had a right to please nobody but herself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_239" id="Page_239">[Pg 239]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why, whom would you have her please?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Sometimes her husband.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> And don't you think a husband under
the same obligation?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Certainly.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why then we are agreed, my Lord&mdash;For
if I never go abroad 'till I am weary of being at home&mdash;&mdash;which
you know is the case&mdash;&mdash;is it not equally
reasonable, not to come home till one's weary of being
abroad!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> If this be your rule of life, Madam, 'tis
time to ask you one serious question?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Don't let it be long a coming then&mdash;&mdash;for
I am in haste.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Madam, when I am serious, I expect a
serious answer.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Before I know the question?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Psha&mdash;&mdash;have I power, Madam, to make
you serious by intreaty?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> You have.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> And you promise to answer me sincerely?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Sincerely.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Now then recollect your thoughts, and
tell me seriously, Why you married me?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> You insist upon truth, you say?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I think I have a right to it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why then, my Lord, to give you, at
once, a proof of my obedience and sincerity&mdash;&mdash;I
think&mdash;&mdash;I married&mdash;to take off that restraint, that lay
upon my pleasures, while I was a single woman.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> How, Madam! is any woman under less
restraint after marriage, than before it?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O my Lord! my Lord! they are quite
different creatures! Wives have infinite liberties in life,
that would be terrible in an unmarried woman to take.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Name one.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Fifty, if you please!&mdash;--to begin then,
in the morning&mdash;&mdash;A married woman may have men
at her toilet, invite them to dinner, appoint them a
party, in a stage box at the play; ingross the conver<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_240" id="Page_240">[Pg 240]</a></span>sation
there, call 'em by their christian names; talk
louder than the players;&mdash;&mdash;From thence jaunt into
the city&mdash;&mdash;take a frolicksome supper at an <em>India</em> house&mdash;&mdash;perhaps
in her <em>gaieté de cœur</em> toast a pretty fellow&mdash;Then
clatter again to this end of the town, break with
the morning, into an assembly, croud to the hazard-table,
throw a familiar <em>levant</em> upon some sharp lurching
man of quality, and if he demands his money, turn it
off with a loud laugh, and cry&mdash;&mdash;you'll owe it him
to vex him! ha! ha!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Prodigious!</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> These now, my Lord, are some few of
the many modish amusements, that distinguish the privilege
of a wife, from that of a single woman.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Death! Madam, what law has made these
liberties less scandalous in a wife, than in an unmarried
woman?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why, the strongest law in the world,
custom&mdash;&mdash;custom time out of mind, my Lord.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Custom, Madam, is the law of fools:
but it shall never govern me.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Nay, then, my Lord, 'tis time for me to
observe the laws of prudence.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I wish I could see an instance of it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> You shall have one this moment, my
Lord; for I think, when a man begins to lose his
temper at home; if a woman has any prudence,
why&mdash;&mdash;she'll go abroad 'till he comes to himself
again.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Going.</em></p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Hold, Madam&mdash;I am amazed, you are not
more uneasy at the life we lead! You don't want sense;
and yet seem void of all humanity: for, with a blush I
say it, I think, I have not wanted love.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Oh! don't say that, my Lord, if you suppose
I have my senses.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> What is it I have done to you? what can
you complain of?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em>. Oh! nothing in the least: 'Tis true, you
have heard me say; I have owed my Lord <em>Lurcher</em> an
hundred pounds these three weeks&mdash;&mdash;but what then?&mdash;&mdash;a
husband is not liable to his wife's debts of honour,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_241" id="Page_241">[Pg 241]</a></span>
you know,&mdash;&mdash;and if a silly woman will be uneasy
about money she can't be sued for, what's that to him?
as long as he loves her, to be sure she can have nothing
to complain of.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> By heaven, if my whole fortune thrown
into your lap, could make you delight in the chearful
duties of a wife, I should think myself a gainer by the
purchase.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> That is, my Lord, I might receive your
whole estate, provided you were sure I would not spend a
shilling of it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> No, Madam; were I master of your
heart, your pleasures would be mine; but different as
they are, I'll feed even your follies to deserve it&mdash;&mdash;Perhaps
you may have some other trifling debts of honour
abroad that keep you out of humour at home&mdash;&mdash;at
least it shall not be my fault, if I have not more of your
company&mdash;&mdash;There, there's a bill of five hundred&mdash;&mdash;and
now, Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> And now, my Lord, down to the ground
I thank you&mdash;&mdash;Now am I convinc'd, were I weak
enough to love this man, I should never get a single
guinea from him.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> If it be no offence, Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Say what you please, my Lord; I am in
that harmony of spirits, it is impossible to put me out of
humour.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> How long then in reason do you think
that sum ought to last you?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Oh, my dear, dear Lord! now you have
spoiled all again! How is it possible I should answer for
an event, that so utterly depends upon fortune? But
to shew you that I am more inclined to get money,
than to throw it away&mdash;&mdash;I have a strong prepossession,
that with this five hundred, I shall win five thousand.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Madam, if you were to win ten thousand,
it would be no satisfaction to me.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O! the churl! ten thousand! what! not
so much as wish I might win ten thousand!&mdash;--Ten<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_242" id="Page_242">[Pg 242]</a></span>
thousand! O! the charming sum! what infinite pretty
things might a woman of spirit do, with ten thousand
guineas! O' my conscience, if she were a woman of true
spirit&mdash;she&mdash;she might lose 'em all again.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> And I had rather it should be so, Madam;
provided I could be sure, that were the last you
would lose.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Well, my Lord, to let you see I design
to play all the good housewife I can; I am now going
to a party of <em>Quadrille</em>, only to piddle with a little
of it at poor two guineas a fish, with the Dutchess of
<em>Quiteright</em>.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit Lady <span class="antiqua">Townly</span>.</em></p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Insensible creature! neither reproaches,
or indulgence, kindness or severity, can wake her to
the least reflection! Continual licence has lull'd her
into such a lethargy of care, that she speaks of her
excesses with the same easy confidence, as if they were
so many virtues. What a turn has her head taken?&mdash;&mdash;But
how to cure it&mdash;&mdash;I am afraid the physic

<p><em>Serv.</em> No, my Lord.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Very well; step up to my sister, and say,

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> So, Lady fair; what pretty weapon have
you been killing your time with!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> A huge folio that has almost killed me&mdash;I
think I have half read my eyes out.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> O! you should not pore so much just
after dinner, child.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_243" id="Page_243">[Pg 243]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> That's true, but any body's thoughts are
better than always one's own, you know.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Who's there?</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Servant.</em>
</p>

<p>Leave word at the door I am at home to nobody but
Mr. <em>Manly</em>.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> And why is he excepted, pray, my Lord?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I hope, Madam, you have no objection
to his company?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Your particular orders upon my being
here, look, indeed, as if you thought I had not.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> And your Ladyship's enquiry into the
reason of those orders, shews, at least, it was not a
matter indifferent to you!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Lord! you make the oddest constructions,
brother!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Look you my grave Lady <em>Grace</em>&mdash;&mdash;in
one serious word&mdash;I wish you had him.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I can't help that.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Ha! you can't help it! ha! ha! The
flat simplicity of that reply was admirable!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pooh! you teize one, brother!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Come, I beg pardon, child&mdash;&mdash;this
is not a point, I grant you, to trifle upon; therefore, I
hope you'll give me leave to be serious.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> If you desire it, brother! though upon
my word, as to Mr. <em>Manly</em>'s having any serious thoughts
of me&mdash;I know nothing of it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Well&mdash;&mdash;there's nothing wrong, in
your making a doubt of it&mdash;&mdash;But, in short, I find, by
his conversation of late, that he has been looking round
the world for a wife; and if you were to look round the
world for a husband, he's the first man I would give to
you.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Then, whenever he makes me an offer,
brother, I will certainly tell you of it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> O! that's the last thing he'll do; he'll
never make you an offer, 'till he's pretty sure it won't be
refus'd.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_244" id="Page_244">[Pg 244]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Now you make me curious. Pray! did
he ever make an offer of that kind to you?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Not directly; but that imports nothing;
he is a man too well acquainted with the female world,
to be brought into a high opinion of any one woman,
without some well examined proof of her merit: Yet
I have reason to believe, that your good sense, your
turn of mind, and your way of life, have brought him
to so favourable a one of you, that a few days will
reduce him to talk plainly to me: Which as yet, (notwithstanding
our friendship) I have neither declin'd nor
encouraged him to.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I am mighty glad we are so near in our
way of thinking: For, to tell you the truth, he is much
upon the same terms with me: You know he has a
satirical turn; but never lashes any folly, without giving
due encomiums to its opposite virtue: and upon such
occasions, he is sometimes particular, in turning his
compliments upon me, which I don't receive, with
any reserve, lest he should imagine I take them to myself.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> You are right, child, when a man of
merit makes his addresses: good sense may give him an
answer, without scorn, or coquetry.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Hush! he's here&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Mr. <span class="antiqua">Manly</span>.</em>

<p><em>Man.</em> My Lord! your most obedient.</p>

to send to you.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Then, I am glad I am here, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;Lady
<em>Grace</em>, I kiss your hands!&mdash;--What, only you
two! How many visits may a man make, before he
falls into such unfashionable company? A brother and
sister soberly sitting at home, when the whole town is a
gadding! I question if there is so particular a <em>tête à
tête</em>, again, in the whole parish of St. <em>James</em>'s.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Fy! fy! Mr. <em>Manly</em>; how censorious
you are!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I had not made the reflexion, Madam, but that
I saw you an exception to it&mdash;Where's my lady?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_245" id="Page_245">[Pg 245]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> That I believe is impossible to guess.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Then I won't try, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> But 'tis probable I may hear of her by
that time I am four or five hours in bed.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Now, if that were my case, I believe I should&mdash;&mdash;But
I beg pardon, my Lord.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Indeed, Sir, you shall not: You will
oblige me, if you speak out; for it was upon this head, I
wanted to see you.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why, then, my Lord, since you oblige me to
proceed&mdash;&mdash;if that were my case&mdash;&mdash;I believe I
should certainly sleep in another house.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> How do you mean?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Only a compliment, Madam.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> A compliment!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Yes, Madam, in rather turning myself out of
doors than her.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Don't you think that would be going too
far?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I don't know but it might, Madam; for in
strict justice, I think she ought rather to go than I.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> This is new doctrine, Mr. <em>Manly</em>.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> As old, Madam, as <em>Love</em>, <em>Honour</em>, and <em>Obey</em>!
When a woman will stop at nothing that's wrong, why
should a man balance any thing that's right.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Bless me, but this is fomenting things&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Fomentations, Madam, are sometimes necessary
to dispel rumours; tho' I don't directly advise my Lord
to do this&mdash;&mdash;This is only what, upon the same provocation,
I would do myself.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Ay! ay! You would do! Batchelors
wives, indeed, are finely governed.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> If the married mens were as well&mdash;&mdash;I am apt
to think we should not see so many mutual plagues taking
the air, in separate coaches!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Well! but suppose it was your own case;
would you part with a wife because she now and then
stays out, in the best company?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Well said, Lady <em>Grace</em>! come, stand up
for the privilege of your sex! This is like to be a warm
debate! I shall edify.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_246" id="Page_246">[Pg 246]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Madam, I think a wife, after midnight, has no
occasion to be in better company than her husband; and
that frequent unreasonable hours make the best company&mdash;&mdash;the
worst company she can fall into.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> But if people of condition are to keep
company with one another; how is it possible to be done
unless one conforms to their hours?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I can't find that any woman's good breeding
obliges her to conform to other people's vices.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I doubt, child, we are got a little on the
wrong side of the question.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why so, my Lord? I can't think the
case so bad, as Mr. <em>Manly</em> states it&mdash;&mdash;People of quality
are not ty'd down to the rules of those, who have their
fortunes to make.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> No people, Madam, are above being ty'd down
to some rules, that have fortunes to lose.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pooh! I'm sure, if you were to take my
side of the argument, you would be able to say something
more for it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Well, what say you to that, <em>Manly</em>?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why, 'troth, my Lord, I have something to
say.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Ay! that I would be glad to hear, now!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Out with it!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Then in one word, this, my Lord, I have often
thought that the mis-conduct of my Lady has, in a
great measure, been owing to your Lordship's treatment
of her.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Bless me!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> My treatment!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Ay, my Lord, you so idoliz'd her before marriage,
that you even indulg'd her like a mistress, after it;
In short, you continued the lover, when you should have
taken up the husband.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> O frightful! this is worse than t'other!
can a husband love a wife too well!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> As easy, Madam, as a wife may love her husband
too little.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> So! you two are never like to agree, I find.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_247" id="Page_247">[Pg 247]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Don't be positive, brother;&mdash;&mdash;I am
afraid we are both of a mind already. [<em>Aside.</em>] And do
you, at this rate, ever intend to be married, Mr. <em>Manly</em>?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Never, Madam; 'till I can meet a woman that
likes my doctrine.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> 'Tis pity but your mistress should hear it.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Pity me, Madam, when I marry the woman
that won't hear it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I think, at least, he can't say that's me.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And so, my Lord, by giving her more power
than was needful, she has none where she wants it; having
such entire possession of you, she is not mistress of herself!
And, mercy on us! how many fine womens heads
have been turn'd upon the same occasion!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> O <em>Manly</em>! 'tis too true! there's the source
of my disquiet! she knows and has abused her power:
Nay, I am still so weak (with shame I speak it) 'tis not
an hour ago, that in the midst of my impatience&mdash;I
gave her another bill for five hundred to throw away.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Well&mdash;&mdash;my Lord! to let you see I am sometimes
upon the side of good nature, I won't absolutely
blame you; for the greater your indulgence, the more
you have to reproach her with.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Ay, Mr. <em>Manly</em>! here now, I begin to
come in with you: Who knows, my Lord, you may
have a good account of your kindness!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> That, I am afraid, we had not best depend upon:
But since you have had so much patience, my Lord, even
go on with it a day or two more; and upon her Ladyship's
next sally, be a little rounder in your expostulation; if
that don't work&mdash;drop her some cool hints of a determin'd
reformation, and leave her&mdash;&mdash;to breakfast upon 'em.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> You are perfectly right! how valuable is
a friend, in our anxiety!</p>

present, we may call another cause.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Ay, for goodness sake let's have done
with this.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> With all my heart.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Have you no news abroad, Mr. <em>Manly</em>?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> <em>A propos</em>&mdash;&mdash;I have some, Madam; and I believe,
my Lord, as extraordinary in its kind&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Pray let's have it.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Do you know that your country neighbour, and
my wise kinsman, Sir <em>Francis Wronghead</em>, is coming to
town with his whole family?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> The fool! what can be his business here?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Oh! of the last importance, I'll assure you&mdash;No
less than the business of the nation.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Explain!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> He has carried his election&mdash;&mdash;against Sir
<em>John Worthland</em>.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> The Deuce! what! for&mdash;&mdash;for&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> The famous borough of <em>Guzzledown</em>!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> A proper representative, indeed.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pray, Mr. <em>Manly</em>, don't I know him?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> You have din'd with him, Madam, when I was
last down with my Lord, at <em>Bellmont</em>.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Was not that he that got a little merry
before dinner, and overset the tea-table, in making his
compliments to my Lady?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> The same.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pray what are his circumstances? I know
but very little of him.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Then he is worth your knowing, I can tell
you, Madam. His estate, if clear, I believe, might be
a good two thousand pounds a year: Though as it was
left him, saddled with two jointures, and two weighty
mortgages upon it, there is no saying what it is&mdash;&mdash;But
that he might be sure never to mend it, he married
a profuse young hussy, for love, without a penny of
money! Thus having, like his brave ancestors, provided
heirs for the family (for his dove breeds like a
tame pigeon) he now finds children and interest-money
make such a bawling about his ears, that at last he has
taken the friendly advice of his kinsman, the good Lord
<em>Danglecourt</em>, to run his estate two thousand pounds more
in debt, to put the whole management of what's left into
<em>Paul Pillage</em>'s hands, that he may be at leisure himself
to retrieve his affairs by being a parliament-man.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> A most admirable scheme, indeed!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And with this politic prospect, he's now upon
his journey to <em>London</em>&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> What can it end in?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Pooh! a journey into the country again.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> And do you think he'll stir, 'till his
money's gone? or at least 'till the session is over?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> If my intelligence is right, my Lord, he won't
sit long enough to give his vote for a turnpike.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> How so?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> O! a bitter business! he had scarce a vote, in
the whole town, beside the returning officer: Sir <em>John</em>
will certainly have it heard at the bar of the house, and
send him about his business again.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Then he has made a fine business of it
indeed.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Which, as far as my little interest will go, shall
be done in as few days as possible.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> But why would you ruin the poor gentleman's
fortune, Mr. <em>Manly</em>?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> No, Madam, I would only spoil his project, to
save his fortune.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> How are you concern'd enough, to do
either?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why, I have some obligations to the family,
Madam: I enjoy at this time a pretty estate, which Sir
<em>Francis</em> was heir at law to: But&mdash;&mdash;by his being
a booby, the last will of an obstinate old uncle gave it
to me.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter a Servant.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Serv.</em> [<em>To <span class="antiqua">Man</span>.</em>] Sir, here's one of your servants from
your house, desires to speak with you.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Will you give him leave to come in, my

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Sir&mdash;&mdash;the ceremony's of your own

<p><em>Man.</em> Well, <em>James</em>! what's the matter now?</p>

<p><em>James.</em> Sir, here's <em>John Moody</em>'s just come to town; he
says Sir <em>Francis</em>, and all the family, will be here to-night,
and is in a great hurry to speak with you.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Where is he?</p>

<p><em>James.</em> At our house, Sir: He has been gaping and
stumping about the streets, in his dirty boots, and asking
every one he meets if they can tell him where he
may have a good lodging for a parliament man, 'till he
can hire a handsome whole house for himself and family,
for the winter.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I am afraid, my Lord, I must wait upon Mr.
<em>Moody</em>.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Pr'ythee! let's have him here: he will
divert us.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> O my Lord! he's such a cub! Not but he's so
near common sense, that he passes for a wit in the family.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I beg of all things we may have him:
I am in love with Nature, let her dress be never so
homely.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Then desire him to come hither, <em>James</em>.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit <span class="antiqua">James</span>.</em></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pray what may be Mr. <em>Moody</em>'s post?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Oh! his <em>Maître d' Hôtel</em>, his butler, his bailiff,
his hind, his huntsman; and sometimes&mdash;&mdash;his companion.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> It runs in my head, that the moment
this Knight has set him down in the house, he will get
up, to give them the earliest proof of what importance
he is to the public, in his own country.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Yes, and when they have heard him, he will
find, that his utmost importance stands valued at&mdash;&mdash;sometimes
being invited to dinner.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> And her Ladyship will make as considerable
a figure, in her sphere too.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> That you may depend upon; for (if I don't
mistake) she has ten times more of the jade in her, than
she yet knows of; and she will so improve in this rich<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_251" id="Page_251">[Pg 251]</a></span>
soil, in a month, that she will visit all the ladies that will let
her into their houses; and run in debt to all the shopkeepers
that will let her into their books: In short, before
her important spouse has made five pounds by his eloquence
at <em>Westminster</em>, she will have lost five hundred at
dice and <em>Quadrille</em>, in the parish of St. <em>James</em>'s.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> So that, by that time he is declared unduly
elected, a swarm of duns will be ready for their
money; and his worship&mdash;&mdash;will be ready for a jail.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Yes, yes, that I reckon will close the account
of this hopeful journey to <em>London</em>&mdash;&mdash;But see, here comes
the fore-horse of the team!</p>

have gone out of your lodgings for any body, that was

<p><em>Moth.</em> Nay, I see nothing against it, Sir, but the
gentleman's being a parliament man: and when people
may, as it were, think one impertinent, or be out of
humour, you know, when a body comes to ask for one's
own&mdash;&mdash;</p>

now pray let's see your game.</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Look you, in one word my cards lie thus&mdash;When
I was down this summer at <em>York</em>, I happened
to lodge in the same house with this Knight's lady, that's
now coming to lodge with you.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Did you so, Sir?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> And sometimes had the honour to breakfast,
and pass an idle hour with her&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Very good; and here I suppose you would have
the impudence to sup, and be busy with her.</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Psha! pr'ythee hear me!</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Is this your game? I would not give sixpence
for it! What, you have a passion for her pin-money&mdash;&mdash;no,
no, country ladies are not so flush of it.</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Nay, if you won't have patience&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> One had need of a great deal, I am sure, to
hear you talk at this rate! Is this your way of making
my poor <em>Myrtilla</em> easy?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Death! I shall do it still, if the woman
will but let me speak&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Had not you a letter from her this morning?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> I have it here in my pocket&mdash;this is it.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Shews it, and puts it up again.</em></p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Hey day! why your blood begins to turn,
my dear! the devil! you did not think I proposed to
marry her myself!</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> If you don't, who the devil do you think will
marry her?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Why, a fool&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Humph! there may be sense in that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Very good&mdash;&mdash;One for t'other then; if I<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_258" id="Page_258">[Pg 258]</a></span>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Your pardon, Sir! ay! ay! in an honourable
affair, you know you may command me&mdash;&mdash;but pray
where is this blessed wife and husband to be had?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Now have a little patience&mdash;&mdash;You must
know then, this country Knight, and his lady, bring up,
in the coach with them, their eldest son and a daughter,
to teach them to&mdash;&mdash;wash their faces, and turn their
toes out.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Good!</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> The son is an unlick'd whelp, about sixteen,
just taken from school; and begins to hanker after
every wench in the family: The daughter much of the
same age, a pert, forward hussy, who having eight
thousand pound left her by an old doating grandmother,
seems to have a devilish mind to be doing in her way
too.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> And your design is to put her into business for
life?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Look you, in short, Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>, we
gentlemen whose occasional chariots roll, only, upon the
four aces, are liable sometimes you know, to have a wheel
out of order: Which, I confess, is so much my case at
present, that my dapple greys are reduced to a pair of
ambling chairmen: Now, if with your assistance, I can
whip up this young jade into a hackney-coach, I may
chance, in a day or two after, to carry her in my own
chariot <em>en famille</em>, to an opera. Now what do you say
to me?</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Why, I shall not sleep&mdash;for thinking of it. But
how will you prevent the family's smoaking your design?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> By renewing my addresses to the mother.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> And how will the daughter like that, think you?</p>

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Very well&mdash;&mdash;whilst it covers her own
affair.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> That's true&mdash;&mdash;it must do&mdash;&mdash;but, as you say,
one for t'other, Sir, I stick to that&mdash;if you don't do my
niece's business with the son, I'll blow you with the

weighty reasons for what I have done, that you will
say, Sir, this is the wisest Journey that ever I made in

<p><em>Man.</em> I think it ought to be, Cousin; for I believe,
you will find it the most expensive one&mdash;your Election

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why ay! it's true! That&mdash;that did lick a

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> With all my heart! the sooner I send him
home again the better.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And this is the scheme you have laid down, to
repair your fortune?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> In one word, Cousin, I think it my duty!
the <em>Wrongheads</em> have been a considerable Family, ever

I have talents where withal, they shan't say it's my

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, the Girl is a little too mettlesome,
it's true! but she has tongue enough: She woan't be
dasht! Then she shall learn to daunce forthwith, and
that will soon teach her how to stond still, you know.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Very well; but when she is thus accomplish'd,
you must still wait for a vacancy.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why I hope one has a good chance for that

that folks are not more willing to get into, than they
are to get out of&mdash;It's like an Orange-tree, upon that
accawnt&mdash;&mdash;it will bear blossoms, and fruit that's ready
to drop, at the same time.</p>

a little more complaisance before me, at least.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Complaisance is only a proof of good

that your good sense could not be disobliged at it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> He will be here presently: He is but just
gone in to my sister.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> So! then my Lady dines with us.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> No; she is engag'd.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I hope you are not of her party, Madam?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Not till after dinner.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And pray how may she have dispos'd of the rest
of the day?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Much as usual! she has visits 'till about
eight; after that 'till court time, she is to be at Quadrille,
at Mrs. <em>Idle</em>'s: After the Drawing-room, she
takes a short supper with my Lady <em>Moonlight</em>. And
from thence, they go together to my Lord <em>Noble</em>'s Assembly.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And are you to do all this with her, Madam?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Only a few of the visits; I would indeed
have drawn her to the Play; but I doubt we have
so much upon our hands, that it will not be practicable.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> But how can you forbear all the rest of it?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> There's no great merit in forbearing,
what one is not charm'd with.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And yet I have found that very difficult in my
time.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> How do you mean?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why, I have pass'd a great deal of my life, in
the hurry of the Ladies, though I was generally better
pleas'd when I was at quiet without 'em.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_279" id="Page_279">[Pg 279]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> What induc'd you, then, to be with
them?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Idleness, and the Fashion.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> No Mistresses in the case?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> To speak honestly&mdash;Yes&mdash;being often in
the toyshop, there was no forbearing the bawbles.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> And of course, I suppose sometimes you
were tempted to pay for them, twice as much as they
were worth.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why really, where fancy only makes the
choice, Madam, no wonder if we are generally bubbled,
in those sort of bargains, which I confess has
been often my case: For I had constantly some Coquette,
or other, upon my hands, whom I could love
perhaps just enough to put it in her power to plague
me.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> And that's a pow'r, I doubt, commonly
made use of.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> The amours of a Coquette, Madam, seldom
have any other view. I look upon Them, and Prudes,
to be nusances, just alike; tho' they seem very different:
The first are always plaguing the Men; and the
other are always abusing the Women.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> And yet both of them do it for the same
vain ends; to establish a false character of being virtuous.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Of being chaste, they mean; for they know no
other virtue: and, upon the credit of that, they traffick
in every thing else that's vicious: They (even
against Nature) keep their chastity, only because they
find they have more power to do mischief with it, than
they could possibly put in practice without it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Hold! Mr. <em>Manly</em>: I am afraid this severe
opinion of the sex, is owing to the ill choice you
have made of your Mistresses.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> In a great measure, it may be so: But, Madam,
if both these characters are so odious; how vastly valuable
is that woman, who has attain'd all they aim at
without the aid of the Folly, or Vice of either?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I believe those sort of women to be as
scarce, Sir, as the men, that believe there are any such;<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_280" id="Page_280">[Pg 280]</a></span>
or that allowing such have virtue enough to deserve
them.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> That <em>could</em> deserve them then&mdash;&mdash;had been
a more favourable reflexion!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Nay, I speak only from my little experience:
For (I'll be free with you, Mr. <em>Manly</em>) I don't
know a man in the world, that, in appearance, might
better pretend to a woman of the first merit, than
yourself: And yet I have a reason in my hand, here,
to think you have your failings.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I have infinite, Madam; but I am sure, the
want of an implicit respect for you, is not among the
number&mdash;&mdash;pray what is in your hand, Madam?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Nay, Sir, I have no title to it; for the
direction is to you.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Gives him a Letter.</em></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> To me! I don't remember the hand&mdash;</p>

opinion of me, Madam.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I hope, at least, it will stand as an excuse
for my taking this liberty.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I never yet saw you do any thing, Madam,
that wanted an excuse; and, I hope, you will not give
me an instance to the contrary, by refusing the favour
I am going to ask you.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I don't believe I shall refuse any, that
you think proper to ask.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Only this, Madam, to indulge me so far, as to
let me know how this letter came into your hands.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Inclos'd to me, in this without a name.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> If there be no secret in the contents, Madam&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why&mdash;&mdash;there is an impertinent insinuation
in it: But as I know your good sense will think
it so too, I will venture to trust you.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_281" id="Page_281">[Pg 281]</a></span></p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Aside.</em></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Tho' my intimacy with my Lord may have
allow'd my visits to have been very frequent here of
late; yet, in such a talking town as this, you must not
wonder, if a great many of those visits are plac'd to
your account: And this taken for granted, I suppose has
been told to my Lady <em>Wronghead</em>, as a piece of news,
since her arrival, not improbably without many more
imaginary circumstances.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> My Lady <em>Wronghead</em>!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Ay, Madam, for I am positive this is her
hand!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> What view could she have in writing it?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> To interrupt any treaty of marriage, she may
have heard I am engaged in: Because if I die without
heirs, her Family expects that some part of my estate
may return to them again. But, I hope, she is so far
mistaken, that if this letter has given you the least uneasiness,&mdash;&mdash;I
shall think that the happiest moment of
my life.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> That does not carry your usual complaisance,
Mr. <em>Manly</em>.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Yes, Madam, because I am sure I can convince
you of my innocence.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I am sure I have no right to inquire
into it.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Suppose you may not, Madam; yet you may
very innocently have so much curiosity.</p>

to have so little of the Woman, in me, as to want curiosity&mdash;&mdash;But
pray, do you suppose then, this <em>Myrtilla</em>
is a real, or a fictitious name?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Now I recollect, Madam, there is a young
woman, in the house, where my Lady <em>Wronghead</em>
lodges, that I heard somebody call <em>Myrtilla</em>: This letter
may be written by her&mdash;&mdash;but how it came directed
to me, I confess is a mystery; that before I ever presume

<p><em>Trusty.</em> Why, it begun, Madam, with his Lordship's
desiring her Ladyship to dine at home to-day&mdash;&mdash;upon
which my Lady said she could not be ready; upon
that, my Lord order'd them to stay the dinner, and
then my Lady order'd the coach; then my Lord took
her short, and said, he had order'd the coachman to
set up: Then my Lady made him a great curt'sy, and
said, she would wait 'till his Lordship's horses had
din'd, and was mighty pleasant: But for fear of the

faults! an agreeable subject truly!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Why, Madam, if you won't hear of
them; how can I ever hope to see you mend them?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why, I don't intend to mend them&mdash;&mdash;I
can't mend them&mdash;&mdash;you know I have try'd to do it an
hundred times, and&mdash;it hurts me so&mdash;I can't bear it!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> And I, Madam, can't bear this daily
licentious abuse of your time and character.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Abuse! Astonishing! when the Universe
knows, I am never better company, than when I am
doing what I have a mind to! But to see this world!
that Men can never get over that silly spirit of contradiction&mdash;&mdash;why
but last <em>Thursday</em> now&mdash;&mdash;there
you wisely amended one of my faults as you call them&mdash;&mdash;you
insisted upon my not going to the Masquerade<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_284" id="Page_284">[Pg 284]</a></span>&mdash;&mdash;and
pray, what was the consequence! was not I as
cross as the Devil, all the night after? was not I forc'd
to get company at home! and was not it almost three
o'clock in the morning, before I was able to come to
myself again? and then the fault is not mended neither,&mdash;&mdash;for
next time, I shall only have twice the inclination
to go: so that all this mending, and mending,
you see, is but dearning an old ruffle, to make it worse
than it was before.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Well, the manner of womens living, of
late, is insupportable; and one way or other&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> It's to be mended, I suppose! why so it
may; but then, my dear Lord, you must give one
time&mdash;&mdash;and when things are at worst, you know,
they may mend themselves! ha! ha!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Madam, I am not in a humour, now,
to trifle.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why then, my Lord, one word of fair
argument&mdash;to talk with you, your own way now&mdash;&mdash;You
complain of my late hours, and I of your early
ones&mdash;&mdash;so far are we even, you'll allow&mdash;&mdash;but pray
which gives us the best figure in the eye of the polite
world? my active, spirited three in the Morning, or
your dull, drowsy eleven at Night? Now, I think, one
has the air of a Woman of Quality, and t'other of a
plodding Mechanic, that goes to bed betimes, that he
may rise early, to open his shop!&mdash;--Faugh!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Fy, fy, Madam! is this your way of
reasoning? 'tis time to wake you then&mdash;&mdash;'tis not
your ill hours alone, that disturb me, but as often the
ill company that occasion those ill Hours.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Sure I don't understand you now, my
Lord; what ill company do I keep?</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Why, at best, women that lose their money,
and men that win it! Or, perhaps, men that are
voluntary bubbles at one game, in hopes a Lady will
give them fair play at another. Then that unavoidable
mixture with known rakes, conceal'd thieves, and
Sharpers in embroidery&mdash;&mdash;or what, to me, is still
more shocking, that herd of familiar chattering crop-ear'd
Coxcombs, who are so often like Monkeys, there<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_285" id="Page_285">[Pg 285]</a></span>
would be no knowing them asunder, but that their tails
hang from their head, and the monkey's grows where
it should do.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> And a Husband must give eminent proof
of his sense, that thinks their powder-puffs dangerous.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Their being fools, Madam, is not always
the Husband's security: Or if it were, fortune, sometimes,
gives them advantages might make a thinking
woman tremble.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> What do you mean!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> That Women, sometimes, lose more than
they are able to pay; and if a creditor be a little pressing,
the Lady may be reduc'd to try if, instead of gold,
the Gentleman will accept of a trinket.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> My Lord you grow scurrilous; you'll
make me hate you. I'll have you to know, I keep
company with the politest people in town, and the
Assemblies I frequent are full of such.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> So are the Churches&mdash;&mdash;now and then.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> My friends frequent them too, at well as
the Assemblies.</p>

of the chambers there were allowed to furnish cards to
the company.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> I see what you drive at all this while;
you would lay an imputation on my fame, to cover
your own avarice! I might take any pleasures I find,
that were not expensive.</p>

want of something to talk upon.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O my Dear, you are the most mistaken
in the world! married people have things to talk of,
child, that never enter into the imagination of others.&mdash;&mdash;Why,
here's my Lord and I now, we have not
been married above two short years, you know, and we
have already eight or ten things constantly in bank, that
whenever we want company, we can take up any one
of them for two hours together, and the subject never
the flatter; nay, if we have occasion for it, it will be
as fresh next day too, as it was the first hour it entertain'd
us.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Certainly that must be vastly pretty.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O! there's no life like it! why t'other
day for example, when you din'd abroad; my Lord
and I, after a pretty chearful <em>tête à tête</em> meal, sat us
down by the fire-side, in an easy indolent, pick-tooth
way, for about a quarter of an hour, as if we had
not thought of any other's being in the room&mdash;&mdash;at
last, stretching himself, and yawning&mdash;&mdash;My Dear,
says he,&mdash;&mdash;aw&mdash;&mdash;you came home very late, last
night&mdash;&mdash;'Twas but just turn'd of Two, says I&mdash;&mdash;I
was in bed&mdash;aw&mdash;&mdash;by eleven, says he; so you are
every night, says I&mdash;&mdash;Well, says he, I am amazed
you can sit up so late&mdash;&mdash;How can you be amaz'd, says
I, at a thing that happens so often?&mdash;&mdash;upon which
we enter'd into a conversation&mdash;&mdash;and tho' this is a
point has entertain'd us above fifty times already, we always
find so many pretty new things to say upon it,
that I believe in my soul, it will last as long as we live.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> But pray! in such sort of family dialogues
(tho' extremely well for passing the time) don't
there, now and then, enter some little witty sort of bitterness?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O yes! which does not do amiss at all!
A smart repartee, with a zest of recrimination at the
head of it, makes the prettiest sherbet; Ay, ay! if
we did not mix a little of the acid with it, a matri<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_288" id="Page_288">[Pg 288]</a></span>monial

elegant taste&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Tho' to tell you the truth, my Dear, I
rather think we squeez'd a little too much lemon into
it, this bout; for it grew so sour at last, that&mdash;I think&mdash;&mdash;I

again&mdash;&mdash;talk'd something oddly of&mdash;&mdash;turning me
out of doors.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Nay, if he should, I may thank my own
wise father for that&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> How so?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why&mdash;&mdash;when my good Lord first
open'd his honourable trenches before me, my unaccountable
Papa, in whose hands I then was, gave me
up at discretion.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> How do you mean?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> He said, the wives of this age were come
to that pass, that he would not desire even his own
Daughter should be trusted with pin-money; so that my
whole train of separate inclinations are left entirely at
the mercy of an husband's odd humours.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why, that, indeed, is enough to make
a woman of spirit look about her!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Nay, but to be serious; my Dear; what
would you really have a woman do in my case?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why&mdash;&mdash;If I had a sober husband as
you have, I would make myself the happiest wife in

one at this rate? when you know he is so very sober,
that (except giving me money) there is not one thing
in the world he can do to please me! And I at the same
time, partly by nature, and partly, perhaps, by keeping
the best company, do with my soul love almost every
thing he hates! I dote upon assemblies! my heart
bounds at a ball; and at an Opera&mdash;&mdash;I expire! then
I love play to distraction! Cards inchant me! and Dice&mdash;put
me out of my little wits! Dear! dear Hazard!<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_289" id="Page_289">[Pg 289]</a></span>
oh! what a flow of spirits it gives one! do you never
play at hazard, child?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Oh! never! I don't think it fits well upon
women; there is something so masculine, so much
the air of a rake in it! you see how it makes the men
swear and curse! and when a woman is thrown into the
same passion&mdash;&mdash;why&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> That's very true! one is a little put to it,
sometimes, not to make use of the same words to express
it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Well&mdash;&mdash;and, upon ill luck, pray what
words are you really forc'd to make use of?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why upon a very hard case, indeed,
when a sad wrong word is rising, just to one's tongue's
end, I give a great gulp&mdash;&mdash;and swallow it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Well&mdash;&mdash;and is not that enough to
make you forswear play, as long as you live?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O yes! I have forsworn it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Seriously?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Solemnly! a thousand times; but then
one is constantly forsworn.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> And how can you answer that?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> My dear, what we say, when we are
losers, we look upon to be no more binding than a lover's
oath, or a great man's promise. But I beg pardon,
child; I should not lead you so far into the world; you
are a prude, and design to live soberly.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why, I confess my nature, and my education
do, in a good degree, incline me that way.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Well! how a woman of spirit, (for you
don't want that, child) can dream of living soberly, is
to me inconceivable! for you will marry I suppose.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I can't tell but I may.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> And won't you live in town?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Half the year, I should like it very well.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> My stars! and you would really live in
London half the year to be sober in it!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why not?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why can't you as well go, and be sober
in the country?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> So I would&mdash;&mdash;t'other half year.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_290" id="Page_290">[Pg 290]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> And pray what comfortable scheme of
life would you form now, for your summer and winter
sober entertainments?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> A scheme, that I think might very well
content us.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> O! of all things let's hear it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why, in summer, I cou'd pass my leisure
hours in riding, in reading, walking by a canal,
or sitting at the end of it under a great tree; in dressing,
dining, chatting with an agreeable friend, perhaps
hearing a little music, taking a dish of tea, or a
game of cards soberly! managing my family, looking
into its accounts, playing with my children (if I
had any) or in a thousand other innocent amusements&mdash;&mdash;soberly!
and possibly, by these means,
I might induce my husband to be as sober as myself&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Well, my dear, thou art an astonishing
creature! for sure such primitive antediluvian notions
of life, have not been in any head these thousand years&mdash;&mdash;Under
a great tree! O my soul!&mdash;--But I beg
we may have the sober town scheme too&mdash;&mdash;for I am
charmed with the country one!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> You shall, and I'll try to stick to my
sobriety there too.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Well, tho' I'm sure it will give me the
vapours, I must hear it however.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why then, for fear of your fainting,
madam, I will first so far come into the fashion, that
I would never be dressed out of it&mdash;&mdash;but still it
should be soberly. For I can't think it any disgrace
to a woman of my private fortune, not to wear her
lace as fine as a wedding-suit of a first Dutchess.
Tho' there is one extravagance I would venture to come
up to.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Ay, now for it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I would every day be as clean as a
bride.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why the men say, that's a great step to
be made one&mdash;&mdash;Well now you are drest&mdash;&mdash;pray let's
see to what purpose.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_291" id="Page_291">[Pg 291]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I would visit&mdash;that is, my real friends;
but as little for form as possible.&mdash;&mdash;I would go to
court; sometimes to an assembly, nay, play at <em>quadrille</em>&mdash;&mdash;soberly;
I would see all the good plays; and,
(because 'tis the fashion) now and then an opera&mdash;&mdash;but
I would not expire there, for fear I should never go
again: and lastly, I can't say, but for curiosity, if I
lik'd my company, I might be drawn in once to a masquerade!
And this, I think, is as far at any woman
can go&mdash;&mdash;soberly.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Well! if it had not been for that last
piece of sobriety, I was just going to call for some surfeit
water.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Why, don't you think, with the farther
aid of breakfasting, dining, taking the air, supping,
sleeping, not to say a word of devotion, the four and
twenty hours might roll over in a tolerable manner?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Tolerable? deplorable! Why, child,
all you propose, is but to endure life, now I want to
enjoy it&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Mrs. <span class="antiqua">Trusty</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Trus.</em> Madam, your Ladyship's chair is ready.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Have the Footmen their white flambeaux
yet? for last night I was poison'd.</p>

<p><em>Trus.</em> Yes, madam: there were some come in this

enjoyment of it.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> You will call on me at Lady <em>Revel</em>'s?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Certainly.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> But I am so afraid it will break into your
scheme, my dear!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> When it does, I will&mdash;&mdash;soberly break
from you.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Why then 'till we meet again, dear sister,
I wish you all tolerable happiness.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> There she goes&mdash;dash! into her stream
of pleasures! poor woman! she is really a fine creature!
and sometimes infinitely agreeable! nay, take her
out of the madness of this town, rational in her notions,
and easy to live with: but she is so borne down
by this torrent of vanity in vogue, she thinks every
hour of her life is lost that she does not lead at the

</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I did not think my Lady <em>Wronghead</em> had
such a notable brain: tho' I can't say she was so very
wise, in trusting this silly girl you call <em>Myrtilla</em>, with the
secret.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> No, my Lord, you mistake me, had the girl
been in the secret, perhaps I had never come at it myself.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Why I thought you said the girl writ
this letter, to you, and that my Lady <em>Wronghead</em> sent it
inclos'd to my sister?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> If you please to give me leave, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;the
fact is thus.&mdash;This inclos'd letter to Lady <em>Grace</em>
was a real original one, written by this girl, to the
Count we have been talking of: the Count drops it,
and my Lady <em>Wronghead</em> finds it: then only changing
the cover, she seals it up as a letter of business, just
written by herself, to me: and pretending to be in a
hurry, gets this innocent girl to write the direction,
for her.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Oh! then the girl did not know she was
superscribing a billet-doux of her own to you?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> No, my Lord; for when I first question'd her
about the direction, she own'd it immediately: but
when I shew'd her that the letter to the Count was
within it, and told her how it came into my hands,
the poor creature was amazed and thought herself betray'd
both by the Count and my Lady&mdash;&mdash;in short,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_293" id="Page_293">[Pg 293]</a></span>
upon this discovery the girl and I grew so gracious,
that she has let me into some transactions, in my Lady
<em>Wronghead</em>'s family, which, with my having a careful
eye over them, may prevent the ruin of it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> You are very generous to be so solicitous
for a Lady that has given you so much uneasiness.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> But I will be most unmercifully reveng'd of her:
for I will do her the greatest friendship in the world&mdash;&mdash;against
her will.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> What an uncommon philosophy art thou
master of? to make even thy malice a virtue?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Yet, my Lord, I assure you, there is no one
action of my life gives me more pleasure than your
approbation of it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Dear <em>Charles</em>! my heart's impatient,
'till thou art nearer to me: and as a proof that I have
long wished thee so: while your daily conduct has chosen
rather to deserve than ask my sister's favour; I have
been as secretly industrious to make her sensible of
your merit: and since on this occasion you have open'd
your whole heart to me, 'tis now with equal pleasure,
I assure you, we have both succeeded&mdash;&mdash;she is as
firmly yours&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Impossible! you flatter me!</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> I am glad you think it flattery: but she
herself shall prove it none: she dines with us alone:
when the servants are withdrawn, I'll open a conversation,
that shall excuse my leaving you together&mdash;<em>O!
Charles!</em> had I, like thee, been cautious in my choice,
what melancholy hours had this heart avoided!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> No more of that, I beg, my Lord&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> But 'twill, at least, be some relief to my
anxiety (however barren of content the state has been
to me) to see so near a friend and sister happy in it:
your harmony of life will be an instance how much the
choice of temper is preferable to beauty.</p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Mrs. <span class="antiqua">Motherly</span>, meeting <span class="antiqua">Myrtilla</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> <span class="smcap"><span class="fauxcap">S</span>o</span>, niece! where is it possible you can have been
these six hours?</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> O! Madam! I have such a terrible story to tell
you!</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> A story! ods my life! what have you done
with the Count's note of five hundred pounds I sent you
about? is it safe? is it good? is it security?</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> Yes, yes, it is safe: but for its goodness&mdash;&mdash;mercy
on us! I have been in a fair way to be hang'd
about it.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> The dickens! has the rogue of a Count play'd
us another trick then?</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> You shall hear, Madam; when I came to Mr.
<em>Cash</em>, the Banker's, and shewed him his note for five
hundred pounds, payable to the Count, or order, in two
months&mdash;he looked earnestly upon it, and desired me
to step into the inner room, while he examined his
books&mdash;&mdash;after I had staid about ten minutes, he came
in to me&mdash;&mdash;claps to the door, and charges me with
a constable for forgery.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Ah poor soul! and how didst thou get off?</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> While I was ready to sink in this condition, I
begg'd him to have a little patience, 'till I could send
for Mr. <em>Manly</em>, whom he knew to be a gentleman of
worth and honour, and who, I was sure, would convince
him, whatever fraud might be in the note, that I
was myself an innocent abus'd woman&mdash;&mdash;and
as good luck would have it, in less than half an
hour Mr. <em>Manly</em> came&mdash;&mdash;so, without mincing the<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_295" id="Page_295">[Pg 295]</a></span>
matter, I fairly told him upon what design the Count
had lodg'd that note in your hands, and in short, laid
open the whole scheme he had drawn us into, to make
our fortune.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> The devil you did!</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> Why how do you think it was possible I could
any otherwise make Mr. <em>Manly</em> my friend, to help me
out of the scrape I was in? To conclude, he soon made
Mr. <em>Cash</em> easy, and sent away the Constable; nay farther
promis'd me, if I would trust the note in his
hands, he would take care it should be be fully paid before
it was due, and at the same time would give
me an ample revenge upon the Count; so that all
you have to consider now, Madam, is, whether you
think yourself safer in the Count's hands, or Mr.
<em>Manly</em>'s.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Nay, nay, child; there is no choice in the
matter! Mr. <em>Manly</em> may be a friend indeed, if any
thing in our power can make him so.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> Well, madam, and now pray how stand matters
at home here? What has the Count done with the
ladies?</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Why every thing he has a mind to do, by this
time, I suppose. He is in as high favour with Miss, as
he is with my Lady.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> Pray, where are the ladies?</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Rattling abroad in their own coach, and the
well-bred Count along with them: they have been
scouring all the shops in town over, buying fine things
and new clothes from morning to night: they have
made one voyage already, and have brought home such
a cargo of bawbles and trumpery&mdash;&mdash;mercy on the
poor man that's to pay for them!</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> Did not the young Squire go with them!</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> No, no; Miss said, truly he would but disgrace
their party: so they even left him asleep by the kitchen
fire.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> Has he not asked after me all this while? for I
had a sort of an assignation with him.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> O yes! he has been in a bitter taking about
it. At last his disappointment grew so uneasy, that<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_296" id="Page_296">[Pg 296]</a></span>
he fairly fell a crying; so to quiet him, I sent one of
the maids and <em>John Moody</em> abroad with him to shew
him&mdash;&mdash;the lions and the Monument. Ods me!

just an as thof it were a cork screw.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> O, the Monument! well, and was it not a fine
sight from the top of it?</p>

<p>Squ. <em>Rich.</em> Sight, Miss! I know no'&mdash;I saw nowght
but smoak and brick housen, and steeple tops&mdash;&mdash;then
there was such a mortal ting-tang of bells, and
rumbling of carts and coaches, and then the folks
under one look'd so small, and made such a hum, and
a buz, it put me in mind of my mother's great glass
bee-hive in our garden in the country.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> I think, Master, you give a very good account
of it.</p>

<p>Squ. <em>Rich.</em> Ay! but I did no like it: for my head&mdash;my
head&mdash;began to turn&mdash;&mdash;so I trundled me dawn

lions, and I lik'd them better by hawlf; they are
pure grim devils; hoh, hoh! I touke a stick, and<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_297" id="Page_297">[Pg 297]</a></span>
gave one of them such a poke o' the noase&mdash;&mdash;I believe

<p><em>Myr.</em> Well, Master, when you and I go abroad, I'll
shew you prettier sights than these&mdash;&mdash;there's a masquerade
to-morrow.</p>

<p>Squ. <em>Rich.</em> O laud! ay! they say that's a pure thing
for <em>Merry Andrews</em>, and those sort of comical mummers&mdash;&mdash;and
the Count tells me, that there lads and
lasses may jig their tails, and eat, and drink, without
grudging, all night-lung.</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> What would you say now, if I should get you a
ticket and go along with you?</p>

<p>Squ. <em>Rich.</em> Ah dear!</p>

<p><em>Myr.</em> But have a care, Squire, the fine ladies there
are terribly tempting; look well to your heart, or ads

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> So they have Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>; they are so
respected when they come home to their Boroughs,
after a session, and so belov'd&mdash;&mdash;that their country
will come and dine with them every day in the
week.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Dear me! what a fine thing it is to be so populous?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> It is a great comfort, indeed! and I can
assure you you are a good sensible woman, Mrs. <em>Motherly</em>.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> O dear Sir, your Honour's pleas'd to compliment.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> No, no, I see you know how to value people
of consequence.</p>

<p><em>Moth.</em> Good lack! here's company, Sir; will you
give me leave to get you a little something 'till the ladies
come home, Sir?</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Exit.</em></p>

<p class="directcenter"><em>Enter Mr. <span class="antiqua">Manly</span>.</em>
</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Sir <em>Francis</em>, your servant.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Cousin <em>Manly</em>!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I am come to see how the family goes on here.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_300" id="Page_300">[Pg 300]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Troth! all as busy as bees; I have been
upon the wing ever since eight o'clock this morning.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> By your early hour, then, I suppose you
have been making your court to some of the great
men.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, faith! you have hit it, Sir&mdash;&mdash;I
was advised to lose no time: so I e'en went straight
forward, to one great man I had never seen in my life
before.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Right! that was doing business: but who had
you got to introduce you?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, no body&mdash;&mdash;I remember'd I had
heard a wise man say&mdash;My son be bold&mdash;so troth! I
introduced myself.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> As how, pray?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, thus&mdash;&mdash;look ye&mdash;&mdash;please your
Lordship, says I, I am Sir <em>Francis Wronghead</em> of <em>Bumper-hall</em>,
and member of Parliament for the borough of
<em>Guzzledown</em>&mdash;&mdash;Sir, your humble servant, says my
Lord; thof I have not the honour to know your person,
I have heard you are a very honest gentleman, and
am glad your Borough has made choice of so worthy
a representative; and so, says he, Sir <em>Francis</em>, have you
any service to command me? Naw, cousin! those
last words, you may be sure gave me no small encouragement.
And thof I know, Sir, you have no extraordinary
opinion of my parts, yet I believe, you won't
say I mist it naw!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Well, I hope I shall have no cause.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> So when I found him so courteous&mdash;&mdash;My
Lord, says I, I did not think to ha' troubled your
Lordship with business upon my first visit: but since your
Lordship is pleas'd not to stand upon ceremony&mdash;&mdash;why
truly, says I, I think naw is as good as another
time.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Right! there you push'd him home.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ay, ay, I had a mind to let him see that I
was none of your mealy-mouth'd ones.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Very good!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_301" id="Page_301">[Pg 301]</a></span></p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> So in short, my Lord, says I, I have a good
estate&mdash;&mdash;but&mdash;&mdash;a&mdash;&mdash;it's a little awt at elbows: and
as I desire to serve my King, as well as my country, I
shall be very willing to accept of a place at Court.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> So, this was making short work on't.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> I'cod! I shot him flying, cousin: some of
your hawf-witted ones naw, would ha' humm'd and
haw'd, and dangled a month or two after him, before
they durst open their mouths about a place, and mayhap,
not ha' got it at last neither.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Oh! I'm glad you're so sure on't&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> You shall hear, cousin&mdash;&mdash;Sir <em>Francis</em>,
says my Lord, pray what sort of a place may you ha'
turn'd your thoughts upon? My Lord, says I, beggars
must not be chusers; but ony a place, says I, about a
thousand a year, will be well enough to be doing with
'till something better falls in&mdash;for I thowght it would
not look well to stond haggling with him at first.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> No, no, your business was to get footing any
way.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Right! there's it! ay, cousin, I see you
know the world!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Yes, yes, one sees more of it every day&mdash;&mdash;well!
but what said my Lord to all this?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Sir <em>Francis</em>, says he, I shall be glad to serve
you any way that lies in my power; so gave me a
squeeze by the hond, as much as to say, give yourself
no trouble&mdash;&mdash;I'll do your business; with that he
turn'd him abawt to somebody with a coloured ribbon across
here, that look'd in my thowghts, as if he came
for a place too.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Ha! so, upon these hopes, you are to make
your fortune!</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, do you think there's ony doubt of
it, Sir?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Oh no, I have not the least doubt about it&mdash;&mdash;for
just as you have done, I made my fortune ten years
ago.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, I never knew you had a place,
cousin.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_302" id="Page_302">[Pg 302]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Nor I neither, upon my faith, cousin. But
you perhaps may have better fortune: for I suppose my
Lord has heard of what importance you were in the debate
to-day&mdash;&mdash;You have been since down at the
house, I presume?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> O yes! I would not neglect the house, for
ever so much.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Well, and pray what have they done there?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, troth! I can't well tell you, what
they have done, but I can tell you what I did: and I
think pretty well in the main; only I happened to make
a little mistake at last indeed.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> How was that?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, they were all got there, into a sort
of a puzzling debate, about the good of the nation&mdash;&mdash;and
I were always for that, you know&mdash;&mdash;but in
short, the arguments were so long winded o' both sides,
that, waunds! I did no well understand 'em, hawsomever,
I was convinc'd, and so resolved to vote right,
according to my conscience&mdash;&mdash;so when they came to
put the question, as they call it,&mdash;&mdash;I don't know haw
'twas&mdash;&mdash;but I doubt I cry'd ay! when I should ha'
cry'd no!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> How came that about?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, by a mistake, as I tell you&mdash;&mdash;for
there was a good-humour'd sort of a gentleman, one
Mr. <em>Totherside</em> I think they call him, that sat next me,
as soon as I had cry'd ay! gives me a hearty shake by
the hand! Sir says he, you are a man of honour, and a
true <em>Englishman</em>! and I should be proud to be better acquainted
with you&mdash;&mdash;and so with that, he takes me
by the sleeve, along with the crowd into the lobby,
so, I knew nowght&mdash;&mdash;but ods-flesh! I was got o'
the wrung side the post&mdash;for I were told, afterwards,
I should have staid where I was.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And so, if you had not quite made your fortune
before, you have clench'd it now!&mdash;--Ah! thou
head of the <em>Wrongheads</em>.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Odso! here's my lady come home at last&mdash;&mdash;I
hope, cousin, you will be so kind, as to take
a family supper with us?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_303" id="Page_303">[Pg 303]</a></span></p>

ask'd me to stay supper: so when your papa and she are
a-bed, Mrs. <em>Myrtilla</em> will let me into the house again;
then you may steal into her chamber, and we'll have a

<p><em>Myr.</em> Well, but how stands your affair with Miss, in

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> O she's mad for the masquerade! it drives

<p>Count <em>Bas.</em> Why ay! Count! That title has been
of some use to me indeed! not that I have any more
pretence to it, than I have to a blue ribband. Yet, I have
made a pretty considerable figure in life with it: I have
loll'd in my own chariot, dealt at assemblies, din'd
with Ambassadors, and made one at quadrille, with the
first women of quality&mdash;&mdash;But&mdash;&mdash;<em>Tempora mutantur</em>&mdash;&mdash;since
that damn'd squadron at <em>White</em>'s have left
me out of their last secret, I am reduced to trade upon
my own stock of industry, and make my last push upon
a wife: if my card comes up right (which I think can't
fail) I shall once more cut a figure, and cock my hat
in the face of the best of them! for since our modern
men of fortune are grown wise enough to be sharpers:
I think sharpers are fools that don't take up the airs of
men of quality.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> <span class="smcap"><span class="fauxcap">T</span>here</span>'s something, Madam, hangs upon
your mind, to-day: is it unfit to trust me
with it?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Since you will know&mdash;&mdash;my sister
then&mdash;&mdash;unhappy woman!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> What of her?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I fear is on the brink of ruin!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I am sorry for it&mdash;&mdash;what has happened?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Nothing so very new! but the continual
repetition of it, has at last rais'd my brother to an intemperance
that I tremble at.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Have they had any words upon it?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> He has not seen her since yesterday.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> What, not at home all night!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> About five this morning in she came!
but with such looks, and such an equipage of misfortunes
at her heels&mdash;&mdash;what can become of her?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Has not my lord seen her, say you?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> No! he chang'd his bed last night&mdash;&mdash;I
sat with him alone till twelve, in expectation of
her: but when the clock had struck, he started from his
chair, and grew incens'd to that degree, that had I not,
almost on my knees, dissuaded him, he had ordered
the doors that instant to have been locked against
her.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> How terrible is his situation? when the most
justifiable severities he can use against her, are liable
to be the mirth of all the dissolute card-tables in
town!</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_312" id="Page_312">[Pg 312]</a></span></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> 'Tis that, I know, has made him bear so
long: but you that feel for him, Mr. <em>Manly</em>, will assist
him to support his honour, and, if possible, preserve
his quiet! therefore I beg you don't leave the house,
'till one or both of them can be wrought to better
temper.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> How amiable is this concern, in you!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> For heaven's sake don't mind me, but
think of something to preserve us all.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I shall not take the merit of obeying your commands,
Madam, to serve my Lord&mdash;&mdash;but pray, Madam,
let me into all that has past, since yesternight.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> When my intreaties had prevail'd upon
my Lord, not to make a story for the town, by so
public a violence, as shutting her at once out of his
doors; he order'd the next apartment to my lady's
to be made ready for him&mdash;&mdash;while that was doing&mdash;&mdash;I
try'd by all the little arts I was mistress of,
to amuse him into temper; in short, a silent grief was
all I could reduce him to&mdash;&mdash;on this, we took our
leaves, and parted to our repose: what his was, I
imagine by my own: for I ne'er clos'd my eyes. About
five, as I told you, I heard my lady at the door; so I
slipt on a gown, and sat almost an hour with her in her
own chamber.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> What said she, when she did not find my Lord
there?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> O! so far from being shock'd or alarm'd
at it; that she blest the occasion! and said that in her
condition, the chat of a female friend was far preferable
to the best husband's company in the world.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Where has she spirits to support so much insensibility?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Nay! it's incredible! for though she
had lost every shilling she had in the world, and
stretch'd her credit ev'n to breaking; she rallied her
own follies with such vivacity, and painted the penance,
she knows she must undergo for them, in such ridiculous
lights, that had not my concern for a brother been
too strong for her wit, she had a'most disarm'd my
anger.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_313" id="Page_313">[Pg 313]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Her mind may have another cast by this time:
the most flagrant dispositions have their hours of anguish;
which their pride conceals from company;
but pray, Madam, how could she avoid coming down
to dine?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> O! she took care of that before she went
to bed; by ordering her woman, whenever she was
ask'd for, to say, she was not well.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> You have seen her since she was up, I presume?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Up! I question whether she be awake yet.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Terrible! What a figure does she make now!
That nature should throw away so much beauty upon a
creature, to make such a slatternly use of it!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> O fy! there is not a more elegant beauty
in town, when she's drest.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> In my eye, Madam, she that's early drest, has
ten times her elegance.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> But she won't be long now, I believe:
for I think I see her chocolate going up&mdash;&mdash;Mrs. <em>Trusty</em>,&mdash;a

<p>Sir <em>Francis</em>, your servant; how came I by the favour of
this extraordinary visit?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ah! cousin!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why that sorrowful face, man?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> I have no friend alive but you&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I am sorry for that&mdash;&mdash;but what's the
matter?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> I have play'd the fool by this journey, I
see now&mdash;&mdash;for my bitter wife&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> What of her?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Is playing the devil!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why truly, that's a part that most of your fine
ladies begin with, as soon as they get to <em>London</em>.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> If I am a living man, cousin, she has made
away with above two hundred and fifty pounds since
yesterday morning!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Hah! I see a good housewife will do a great
deal of work in a little time.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Work do they call it! fine work indeed!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Well, but how do you mean made away with it?
What, she has laid it out, may be&mdash;&mdash;but I suppose you
have an account of it.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Yes, yes, I have had the account indeed;
but I mun needs say, it's a very sorry one.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Pray, let's hear.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, first I let her have an hundred and
fifty, to get things handsom about her, to let the world
see that I was somebody! and I thought that sum
very genteel.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_315" id="Page_315">[Pg 315]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Indeed I think so; and in the country, might
have serv'd her a twelvemonth.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why so it might&mdash;&mdash;but here in this
fine tawn, forsooth! it could not get through four and
twenty hours&mdash;&mdash;for in half that time, it was all
squandered away in baubles, and new fashion'd
trumpery.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> O! for ladies in <em>London</em>, Sir <em>Francis</em>, all this
might be necessary.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Noa, theere's the plague on't! the devil
o' one useful thing do I see for it, but two pair of lac'd
shoes, and those stond me in three pound three shillings
a pair too.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Dear Sir! this is nothing! Why we have city
wives here, that while their good man is selling three
penny worth of sugar, will give you twenty pound for
a short apron.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Mercy on us! what a mortal poor devil is
a husband!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Well, but I hope you have nothing else to complain
of?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ah would I could say so too&mdash;but there's
another hundred behind yet, that goes more to my heart,
than all that went before it.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> And how might that be disposed of?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Troth I am almost ashamed to tell you.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Out with it.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why she has been at an assembly.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> What, since I saw you! I thought you had all
supt at home last night?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, so we did&mdash;&mdash;and all as merry as
grigs&mdash;&mdash;I'cod! my heart was so open, that I toss'd
another hundred into her apron, to go out early this
morning with&mdash;&mdash;but the cloth was no sooner taken
away, than in comes my Lady <em>Townly</em> here, (&mdash;&mdash;who
between you and I&mdash;&mdash;mum! has had the devil to pay
yonder&mdash;&mdash;) with another rantipole dame of quality,
and out they must have her, they said, to introduce her
at my Lady <em>Noble</em>'s assembly forsooth&mdash;&mdash;a few words,<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_316" id="Page_316">[Pg 316]</a></span>
you may be sure, made the bargain&mdash;&mdash;so, bawnce!
and away they drive as if the devil had got into the
coach box&mdash;so about four or five in the morning&mdash;&mdash;home
comes Madam, with her eyes a foot deep in her
head&mdash;&mdash;and my poor hundred pound left behind her
at the hazard-table.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> All lost at dice!</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Every shilling&mdash;&mdash;among a parcel of
pig-tail puppies, and pale fac'd women of quality.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> But pray, Sir <em>Francis</em>, how came you, after you
found her so ill an housewife of one sum, so soon to
trust her with another?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why truly I mun say that was partly my
own fault: for if I had not been a blab of my
tongue, I believe that last hundred might have been
sav'd.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> How so?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why, like an owl as I was, out of goodwill,
forsooth, partly to keep her in humour, I must
needs tell her of the thousand pound a year, I had just
got the promise of&mdash;I'cod! she lays her claws upon
it that moment&mdash;&mdash;said it was all owing to her
advice, and truly she would have her share on't.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> What, before you had it yourself?</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why ay! that's what I told her&mdash;&mdash;My
dear, said I, mayhap I mayn't receive the first quarter
on't this half year.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Sir <em>Francis</em>, I have heard you with a great
deal of patience, and I really feel compassion for
you.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Truly and well you may cousin, for I
don't see that my wife's goodness is a bit the better, for
bringing to <em>London</em>.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> If you remember I gave you a hint of it.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Why ay, it's true you did so: but the
devil himself could not have believ'd she would have rid
post to him.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Sir, if you stay but a fortnight in this town<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_317" id="Page_317">[Pg 317]</a></span>
you will every day see hundreds as fast upon the gallop,
as she is.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ah! this <em>London</em> is a base place indeed&mdash;&mdash;waunds,
if things should happen to go wrong with me
at <em>Westminster</em>, at this rate, how the devil shall I keep
out of jail!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Why truly, there seems to me but one way to
avoid it.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ah! wou'd you could tell me that, cousin.</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> The way lies plain before you, Sir; the same
road that brought you hither will carry you safe home
again.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ods-flesh! cousin, what! and leave a thousand
pound a year behind me?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Pooh! pooh! leave any thing behind you, but
your family, and you are a saver by it.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Ay, but consider, cousin, what a scurvy
figure I shall make in the country, if I come dawn
withawt it!</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> You will make a much more lamentable figure
in jail without it.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Mayhap 'at yow have no great opinion of it
then, cousin?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Sir <em>Francis</em>, to do you the service of a real
friend, I must speak very plainly to you: you don't yet
see half the ruin that's before you.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Good-lack! how may yow mean, cousin?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> In one word, your whole affairs stand thus&mdash;&mdash;In
a week you'll lose your seat at <em>Westminster</em>:
In a fortnight my lady will run you into jail,
by keeping the best company&mdash;&mdash;In four and
twenty hours, your daughter will run away with a
sharper, because she han't been us'd to better company:
and your son will steal into marriage with a
cast-mistress, because he has not been us'd to any company
at all.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> I'th' name of goodness why should you
think all this?</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_318" id="Page_318">[Pg 318]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Man.</em> Because I have proof of it; in short, I know
so much of their secrets, that if all this is not prevented
to-night, it will be out of your power to do it to-morrow
morning.</p>

<p>Sir <em>Fran.</em> Mercy upon us! you frighten me&mdash;&mdash;Well,
Sir, I will be govern'd by yow: but what am I
to do in this case?</p>

<p><em>Man.</em> I have not time here to give you proper instructions;

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Madam, Madam! I will be heard, and

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> After those you have given me, Madam,
'tis almost infamous to talk with you.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> I scorn your imputation and your menaces!
The narrowness of your heart's your monitor!
'tis there! there, my lord, you are wounded; you
have less to complain of than many husbands of an
equal rank to you.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Death, Madam! do you presume upon
your corporal merit! that your person's less tainted,
than your mind! is it there! there alone an honest
husband can be injur'd? Have you not every other<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_324" id="Page_324">[Pg 324]</a></span>
vice that can debase your birth, or stain the heart of
woman? Is not your health, your beauty, husband,
fortune, family disclaim'd, for nights consumed in
riot and extravagance? The wanton does no more;
if she conceals her shame, does less: And sure the dissolute
avow'd, as sorely wrongs my honour, and my
quiet.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> I see, my Lord, what sort of wife might
please you.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Ungrateful woman! could you have seen
yourself, you in yourself had seen her&mdash;&mdash;I am amaz'd
our legislature has left no precedent of a divorce for
this more visible injury, this adultery of the mind, as
well as that of the person! when a woman's whole
heart is alienated to pleasures I have no share in, what
is't to me whether a black ace, or a powder'd coxcomb
has possession of it?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> If you have not found it yet, my lord,
this is not the way to get possession of mine, depend
upon it.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> That, Madam, I have long despair'd of;
and since our happiness cannot be mutual, 'tis fit, that
with our hearts, our persons too should separate.&mdash;&mdash;This
house you sleep no more in! tho' your content
might grosly feed upon the dishonour of a husband,
yet my desires would starve upon the features of a
wife.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Your stile, my lord, is much of the same
delicacy with your sentiments of honour.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> Madam, Madam! this is no time for
compliments&mdash;&mdash;I have done with you.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> If we had never met, my Lord, I had

not, perhaps, be so easily recall'd as you imagine.</p>

vices that misuse 'em&mdash;&mdash;The decent necessaries of

to receive you; where if time, and your condition
brings you to a due reflection, your allowance shall
be increased&mdash;&mdash;But if you still are lavish of your little,
or pine for past licentious pleasures, that little shall be
less! nor will I call that soul my friend, that names you

vice or of decay! There I proposed the partner of an
easy home! There I for ever hoped to find, a chearful
companion, an agreeable intimate, a faithful friend,
a useful help-mate, and a tender mother&mdash;&mdash;But oh!

her from my heart for ever) let me not urge her punishment
beyond her crimes&mdash;&mdash;I know the world is
fond of any tale that feeds its appetite of scandal: and
as I am conscious, severities of this kind seldom fail of
imputations too gross to mention, I here, before you

that fame, I thought mankind my slaves, I triumph'd
over hearts while all my pleasure was their pain: yet
was my own so equally insensible to all, that when a
father's firm commands enjoin'd me to make choice of
one, I even there declin'd the liberty he gave, and to
his own election yielded up my youth&mdash;&mdash;his tender
care, my Lord, directed him to you&mdash;&mdash;Our hands
were join'd! But still my heart was wedded to its folly!
My only joy was power, command, society, profuseness,
and to lead in pleasures! The husband's right to
rule, I thought a vulgar law, which only the deform'd
or meanly spirited obey'd! I knew no directors, but
my passions; no matter but my will! even you, my lord,
some time o'ercome by love, was pleas'd with my
delights; nor, then foresaw this mad misuse of your
indulgence&mdash;&mdash;And, though I call myself ungrateful,
while I own it, yet as a truth, it cannot be deny'd&mdash;&mdash;That
kind indulgence has undone me! it
added strength to my habitual failings, and in a heart
thus warm, in wild unthinking life, no wonder if the
gentler sense of love was lost.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> A great many people, my Lord, but no
company&mdash;&mdash;as you'll find&mdash;&mdash;for here's one now,
that seems to have a mind to entertain us.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>A mask, after some affected gesture, makes up to

<p><em>Mask.</em> Well, dear Lady <em>Townly</em>, shan't we see you,

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Yes, I could guess wrong, I believe.</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> That's what I'd have you to do.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> But, Madam, if I don't know you at all,
is not that as well?</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> Ay, but you do know me.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Town.</em> Dear sister, take her off o' my hands;
there's no bearing this.</p>

<p class="directright">[<em>Apart.</em></p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> I fancy I know you, Madam.</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> I fancy you don't: what makes you think
you do?</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Because I have heard you talk.</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> Ay, but you don't know my voice, I'm sure.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> There is something in your wit and
humour, Madam, so very much your own, it is impossible
you can be any body but my Lady <em>Trifle</em>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_332" id="Page_332">[Pg 332]</a></span></p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> [Unmasking.] Dear Lady Grace! thou art a
charming creature.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Is there no body else we know here?</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> O dear, yes! I have found out fifty already.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pray who are they?</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> O, charming company! there's Lady <em>Ramble</em>&mdash;&mdash;Lady

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> But you have given us no account of the
men, Madam. Are they good for any thing?</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> O yes! you must know, I always find out them
by their endeavours to find out me.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Pray who are they?</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> Why, for your men of tip-top wit and pleasure,
about town, there's my Lord&mdash;&mdash;<em>Bite</em>&mdash;&mdash;Lord
<em>Arch-wag</em>&mdash;&mdash;Young <em>Brazen-wit</em>&mdash;&mdash;Lord

Magpye</em>&mdash;&mdash;Beau <em>Frightful</em>&mdash;&mdash;Sir <em>Paul Plaster-crown</em>,
and the Marquis of <em>Monkey-man</em>.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Right; and these are fine gentlemen that
never want elbow-room at an assembly.</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> The rest I suppose, by their tawdry hired habits
are tradesmens wives, inns-of-court beaus, <em>Jews</em>, and
kept mistresses.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> An admirable collection!</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Well, of all our public diversions, I
am amaz'd how this, that is so very expensive, and has
so little to shew for it, can draw so much company together.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_333" id="Page_333">[Pg 333]</a></span></p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> O! if it were not expensive, the better
sort would not come into it: and because money can
purchase a ticket, the common people scorn to be kept
out of it.</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> Right, my Lord, poor Lady Grace! I suppose
you are under the same astonishment, that an opera
should draw so much good company.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> Not at all, Madam; it is an easier matter
sure to gratify the ear, than the understanding. But
have you no notion, Madam, of receiving pleasure and
profit at the same time?</p>

<p><em>Mask.</em> Oh! quite none! unless it be sometimes winning
a great stake; laying down a Vole, sans prendre
may come up, to the profitable pleasure you were speaking
of.</p>

<p>Lady <em>Grace.</em> But see, my Lord, we had best adjourn
our debate, I believe, for here are some masks that
seem to have a mind to divert other people as well as
themselves.</p>

<p>Lord <em>Town.</em> The least we can do is to give them a
clear stage then.</p>

corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
